## Skills Upload 

This is a folder used to allow drag and drop commits of skills to this repo, bypassing regular git operations.  A lot of (all?) my skills are vibe coded, many (all so far) 
in Claude.ai, (some from my phone!) and I wanted a simple way to persist these in the repo.

After upload the .github/workflows/skill-upload.yml action kicks off, extracting the skill and creating/updating the corresponding code folder and files, then upon success the .zip file is deleted

Or that's the theory anyhow...
