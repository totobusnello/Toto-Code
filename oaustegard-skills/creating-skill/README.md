> **⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This skill has been integrated into **crafting-instructions** with clean progressive disclosure.

For creating Skills, use the **crafting-instructions** skill instead:
- Overview: `crafting-instructions/SKILL.md` → § For Skills
- Detailed guidance: `crafting-instructions/references/creating-skills.md`
- Advanced topics: `crafting-instructions/references/skill-creation/`

This provides better organization and prevents skill-specific details from bleeding into general prompting guidance.
