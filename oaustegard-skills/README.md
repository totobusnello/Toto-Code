# claude-skills
My collection of Claude skills -- primarily used for the Claude.ai PaaS skill compute environment, mileage will vary if attempted used as Claude Code Agent Skills 

## Installing Skills

### For Claude.ai (Web/Mobile)

1. To install a skill in Claude.ai you first need a paid account (Claude Pro or Team)
2. Download the skill ZIP from the [Releases page](../../releases)
   - **Note:** Each release includes a direct download link for the skill ZIP - use that, not the "Source code" archives auto-generated by GitHub
3. Upload to [Claude.ai Skills Settings](https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities)
4. See [official documentation](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-how-to-create-custom-skills) for more details

### For Claude Code (Automated Installation)

Install skills directly to your project with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oaustegard/claude-skills/main/templates/installation/install-skills.sh | bash
```

Or download and customize which skills to install:

```bash
# Download the script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oaustegard/claude-skills/main/templates/installation/install-skills.sh

# Edit SKILLS array to select which skills to install
nano install-skills.sh

# Run installation
chmod +x install-skills.sh
./install-skills.sh
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Installs skills to `.claude/skills/` directory
- ✅ Always pulls latest versions from main branch
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of workflow metadata
- ✅ Customizable skill selection

**CI/CD Integration:**

Set up automated skill updates with GitHub Actions:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
curl -o .github/workflows/install-skills.yml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oaustegard/claude-skills/main/templates/installation/install-skills.yml
```

Then trigger via: **Actions** → **Install Claude Skills** → **Run workflow**

For complete documentation, see [templates/installation/README.md](templates/installation/README.md)

## Contributing Skills

(Not actually sure about the workflow for a forked repo back to mine -- someone will have to test and report, but within your _own_ fork:...)

### Via ZIP Upload (Easiest)

1. Create your skill folder with `SKILL.md` at the root
2. Package your skill:
   ```bash
   # Correct structure:
   your-skill.zip
     └── your-skill/
         ├── SKILL.md
         └── resources/  (optional)

   # NOTE: Do NOT include a VERSION file in your ZIP
   # VERSION files are workflow metadata and will be ignored
   ```
3. Upload the ZIP to the `uploads/` directory
4. The workflow will automatically create a PR with your skill content
5. When ready to release, update the VERSION file separately (see "Releasing Skills" below)

### Via Direct Development

1. Create a new branch
2. Add your skill folder at the repository root (SKILL.md and resources)
3. Submit a PR with your skill content
4. When ready to release, update the VERSION file separately (see "Releasing Skills" below)

## Releasing Skills

**Important:** VERSION files are workflow metadata, separate from skill content.

- Releases are triggered **explicitly** by updating VERSION files on main branch
- Simply changing skill content does NOT trigger a release
- This separation allows you to iterate on skills without creating releases for every change

### How It Works

1. **Develop & Update:** Upload ZIPs or edit skill files directly → PRs update skill content in repo
2. **Release When Ready:** Update VERSION file → Automatic release created with downloadable ZIP

### Creating a New Release

1. Update the `VERSION` file in your skill folder:
   ```bash
   echo "1.1.0" > your-skill/VERSION
   ```

2. Commit and push (or merge PR):
   ```bash
   git add your-skill/VERSION
   git commit -m "chore: bump your-skill to v1.1.0"
   git push
   ```

3. The workflow will automatically:
   - Create a properly structured ZIP file (VERSION excluded - it's not part of the skill)
   - Generate a GitHub release with tag `your-skill-v1.1.0`
   - Attach the ZIP as a release asset
   - Generate release notes from recent commits
   - Users download this ZIP to install the skill

### Manual Release

You can also trigger a release manually via GitHub Actions:

1. Go to Actions → Release Skill → Run workflow
2. Enter the skill folder name
3. Optionally specify a version (otherwise uses VERSION file)

### Version Format

Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):
- `1.0.0` - Initial release
- `1.0.1` - Patch (bug fixes)
- `1.1.0` - Minor (new features, backward compatible)
- `2.0.0` - Major (breaking changes)
