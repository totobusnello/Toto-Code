# building-github-index

Generate progressive disclosure indexes for GitHub repositories to use as Claude project knowledge. Use when setting up projects referencing external documentation, creating searchable indexes of technical blogs or knowledge bases, combining multiple repos into one index, or when user mentions "index", "github repo", "project knowledge", or "documentation reference".
