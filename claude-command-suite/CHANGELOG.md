### Claude Code Skills

Introduction of Claude Code Skills - model-invoked capabilities that complement slash commands for recurring workflows and domain expertise.

#### Overview

Skills are contextually triggered by Claude, while slash commands require explicit invocation. Skills are suitable for recurring workflows, domain expertise, and reusable automation.

| Feature | **Skills** (Model-Invoked) | **Commands** (User-Invoked) |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Activation** | Claude decides automatically | You type `/command` |
| **Use Case** | Recurring workflows, expertise | Specific one-time tasks |
| **Scope** | Personal or project-wide | Project-specific |
| **Distribution** | Share via git or plugins | Copy command files |

  - Code-execution template - Bundled scripts
  - Enhanced templates - Production-ready variations

- **Validation & Testing**:
  - YAML frontmatter validation
  - Structure verification
  - Script execution testing
  - Trigger phrase validation
  - Quality scoring system

- **Documentation**:
  - [Skills README](.claude/commands/skills/README.md) - Complete reference
  - [Quick Start Guide](.claude/commands/skills/QUICKSTART.md) - Creation walkthrough
  - Template documentation
  - Best practices

#### Features

- Progressive disclosure for complex workflows

#### Usage Patterns

Skills and commands serve different purposes:

**Skills** - Recurring workflows, domain expertise, automatic triggering, reusable automation

**Commands** - Specific tasks, explicit control, project-specific workflows, structured execution
