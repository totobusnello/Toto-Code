## Filler Words to Remove

**Remove these words entirely (they add no meaning):**

- simply
- quickly
- easily
- basically
- actually
- really
- very (use stronger adjective instead)
- on top of that (use "and")
- in many cases (use "often")

## Example Transformation

```markdown
❌ Before (48 words):
"In order to execute tasks, x-task-executor has the ability to load the task
from Linear. At this point in time, the skill provides a description of the
implementation approach. It is important to note that quality gates are run
prior to completion."

✅ After (26 words, -46% reduction):
"To execute tasks, x-task-executor can load the task from Linear.
Now, the skill describes the implementation approach.
Quality gates run before completion."
```

## Additional Rules

1. **Active Voice:** Convert "tasks are executed by the skill" → "the skill executes tasks"
2. **Sentence Length:** Max 20-25 words per sentence
3. **Paragraph Length:** 3-5 sentences, one idea per paragraph
