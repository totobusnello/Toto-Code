## Refactoring Goal

**Primary Goal:**
Resolve all identified code quality issues while preserving 100% of existing functionality.

**Specific Objectives:**
- [ ] Fix all DRY violations (eliminate code duplication)
- [ ] Fix all KISS violations (simplify over-engineered solutions)
- [ ] Fix all YAGNI violations (remove unused/premature features)
- [ ] Fix all architecture issues (restore proper layer boundaries)
- [ ] Fix all guide violations (align with project patterns)

**Success Criteria:**
- All issues from Code Quality Issues section resolved
- All existing tests pass (regression verification)
- Functionality unchanged (verified through manual testing)
- Code quality metrics improved (measurable reduction in complexity/duplication)

---

## Refactoring Plan (3 Phases)

### Phase 1: Analysis & Preparation

**Baseline Capture:**
- [ ] Run existing test suite -> Record pass/fail count (baseline for Phase 3)
- [ ] Document current behavior:
  - Take screenshots of key UI states (if UI changes)
  - Capture API responses for key endpoints (if backend changes)
  - Record timing benchmarks (if performance-sensitive)
- [ ] Identify all affected tests:
  - `rg "ClassName|functionName" tests/` -> Find tests that exercise refactored code
  - Review test files to understand test coverage
- [ ] Create backup branch (git branch backup/refactor-[feature-name])

**Best Practices Research:**
- [ ] Research DRY patterns (MCP Ref, Context7, WebSearch)
  - Query: "DRY principle [language] best practices 2024"
  - Find established patterns for consolidating duplicated code
- [ ] Research KISS simplification (if applicable)
  - Query: "simplify [over-engineered pattern] [language]"
  - Find simpler alternatives to current implementation
- [ ] Review project guides (CLAUDE.md, {{DOCS_PATH}}/guides/)
  - Verify patterns referenced in Story Technical Notes
  - Ensure refactoring aligns with project standards

**Risk Assessment:**
- [ ] Identify high-risk refactorings (core business logic, critical paths)
- [ ] Plan incremental approach (small changes, test after each)
- [ ] Document rollback plan (if refactoring fails)

### Phase 2: Refactoring Execution

**Execute refactorings in priority order (HIGH -> MEDIUM -> LOW):**

**Issue 1: [HIGH Priority]**
- [ ] [Step 1: Specific action - e.g., "Create shared utility function in utils/validators.py"]
- [ ] [Step 2: Specific action - e.g., "Replace 3 duplicates in api/routes/*.py"]
- [ ] [Step 3: Specific action - e.g., "Add unit tests for new utility function"]
- [ ] Run tests after Issue 1 fix (verify no regression)

**Issue 2: [MEDIUM Priority]**
- [ ] [Step 1: Specific action]
- [ ] [Step 2: Specific action]
- [ ] Run tests after Issue 2 fix

**Issue 3: [LOW Priority]**
- [ ] [Step 1: Specific action]
- [ ] [Step 2: Specific action]
- [ ] Run tests after Issue 3 fix

**Incremental Approach:**
- Fix one issue at a time
- Run tests after each fix (catch regressions immediately)
- Commit after each successful fix (git commit -m "refactor: fix [issue]")
- If any test fails -> STOP, analyze, fix refactoring (not test)

### Phase 3: Regression Verification

**Verify functionality unchanged:**

- [ ] **Run test suite again:**
  - Compare with Phase 1 baseline
  - MUST match exactly (same pass/fail count, same test names)
  - If ANY test fails -> Refactoring introduced bug, MUST fix

- [ ] **Compare behavior with baseline:**
  - API responses MUST be identical (diff outputs)
  - UI screenshots MUST match (visual regression)
  - Timing within 5% of baseline (performance not degraded)

- [ ] **Manual smoke testing:**
  - Test main user flows (verify no behavior change)
  - Use `scripts/tmp_[story_id].sh` if exists (from manual testing)
  - Document any unexpected behavior

- [ ] **Quality gates:**
  - Type checking passes (mypy/TypeScript)
  - Linting passes (ruff/ESLint)
  - No new warnings introduced

**If verification fails:**
- [ ] Analyze failure root cause (refactoring bug vs test bug)
- [ ] Fix refactoring (preferred) OR update test (only if test was wrong)
- [ ] Re-run Phase 3 verification

---

## Regression Testing Strategy

> [!WARNING]
> Refactoring NEVER changes functionality. If tests fail after refactoring -> Implementation error.

### Baseline Capture (Phase 1)

**Test Suite Baseline:**
```bash
# Run full test suite, capture output
pytest -v > baseline_tests.txt  # or npm test, etc.

# Record metrics
Total tests: [X]
Passed: [X]
Failed: [X]
Skipped: [X]
```

**Behavior Baseline (for critical functionality):**
```bash
# Capture API responses
curl -X GET $BASE_URL/api/endpoint > baseline_api_response.json

# Capture UI state (if applicable)
# Screenshot key pages, record element states
```

**Performance Baseline (if performance-sensitive):**
```bash
# Record timing benchmarks
pytest --benchmark-only > baseline_benchmarks.txt
```

### Verification Protocol (Phase 3)

**Step 1: Test Suite Comparison**
- Run test suite again -> Compare with baseline
- **Expected:** Exact match (same tests pass/fail)
- **If mismatch:** STOP, analyze failure, fix refactoring

**Step 2: Behavior Comparison**
- Capture API responses again -> Diff with baseline
- **Expected:** Identical responses (diff shows no changes)
- **If different:** STOP, analyze, fix refactoring

**Step 3: Performance Comparison**
- Run benchmarks again -> Compare with baseline
- **Expected:** Within 5% of baseline timing
- **If degraded >5%:** Analyze, optimize refactoring

### Failure Handling

**If ANY test fails after refactoring:**

1. **STOP immediately** - Do NOT proceed with additional refactorings
2. **Analyze root cause:**
   - Read test failure message
   - Identify which refactoring caused failure
   - Determine if refactoring introduced bug OR test needs update
3. **Fix refactoring (preferred approach):**
   - Revert last change: `git revert HEAD`
   - Re-analyze issue, apply safer refactoring
   - Run tests again
4. **Update test (only if test was wrong):**
   - Verify test expectation was incorrect (not refactoring bug)
   - Update test assertions/mocks
   - Document why test update needed (in commit message)
5. **Re-run Phase 3 verification**

**Tools:**
- Test framework: pytest/jest/vitest (auto-detected in Phase 1)
- Diff tools: `diff`, `jq` (for JSON), screenshot comparison
- Performance: pytest-benchmark, Lighthouse (if UI)

---

## Code Simplification Principles

Apply these principles during Phase 2 refactoring:

### 1. Preserve Functionality (HARD RULE)

**Rule:** NEVER change what code does - only HOW it does it.

- X **Forbidden:** Change outputs, modify behavior, alter features
- V **Allowed:** Change structure, consolidate logic, rename variables
- V **Verification:** All existing tests MUST pass after refactoring

**Example:**
```python
# WRONG: Changed behavior
def validate_email(email):
    # Before: allowed @gmail.com and @yahoo.com
    # After: ONLY allows @gmail.com (BEHAVIOR CHANGED - FORBIDDEN!)
    return email.endswith('@gmail.com')

# CORRECT: Same behavior, refactored
def validate_email(email):
    # Before: inline validation in 3 places
    # After: extracted to shared function (SAME BEHAVIOR - ALLOWED!)
    allowed_domains = ('@gmail.com', '@yahoo.com')
    return email.endswith(allowed_domains)
```

### 2. Apply Project Standards

**Follow CLAUDE.md coding standards:**
- ES modules with proper imports
- Explicit type annotations
- Proper error handling (avoid try/catch when possible)
- Consistent naming conventions

**Example:**
```typescript
// Before: Non-standard
const getUser = (id) => { ... }

// After: Project standard (explicit types, function keyword)
function getUser(id: string): User | null { ... }
```

### 3. Enhance Clarity

**Reduce complexity, improve readability:**
- V Reduce nesting (extract nested logic to functions)
- V Eliminate redundant code (DRY principle)
- V Clear names (intent-revealing variable/function names)
- V Consolidate related logic (group cohesive operations)
- V Remove unnecessary comments (self-documenting code)
- V Avoid nested ternaries (use switch/if-else for multiple conditions)

**Example:**
```python
# Before: Nested and unclear
if user:
    if user.active:
        if user.verified:
            return user.data
return None

# After: Clear and flat
if not user or not user.active or not user.verified:
    return None
return user.data
```

### 4. Maintain Balance (DON'T Over-Simplify)

**Avoid extreme simplification:**
- X Don't reduce clarity for brevity (explicit > compact)
- X Don't combine too many concerns (single responsibility)
- X Don't remove helpful abstractions
- X Don't prioritize "fewer lines" over readability

**Example:**
```javascript
// WRONG: Over-simplified (hard to understand)
const r = u?.a && u?.v ? u?.d : null;

// CORRECT: Clear and explicit
if (!user || !user.active || !user.verified) {
    return null;
}
return user.data;
```

### 5. Focus Scope

**Only refactor what's in scope:**
- V Refactor code identified in Code Quality Issues section
- V Refactor closely related code (within same module/class)
- X Don't expand scope beyond identified issues
- X Don't refactor unrelated files

**Example:**
```
Issue: Duplicate validation in api/routes/users.py and api/routes/auth.py
V Refactor: Extract validation to utils/validators.py
V Refactor: Update imports in both route files
X Don't refactor: Other unrelated routes (outside scope)
```
