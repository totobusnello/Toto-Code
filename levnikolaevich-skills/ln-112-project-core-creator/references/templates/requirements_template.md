---

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)

{{HIGH_LEVEL_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA}}
<!-- Example:
1. All MUST functional requirements implemented and passing tests
2. All SHOULD functional requirements reviewed and prioritized
3. All critical user journeys end-to-end tested
4. Acceptance criteria verified for each requirement
5. Traceability matrix complete (FR → Epic → Story → Test Case)
-->

---

## 5. Constraints

### 5.1 Technical Constraints
{{TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS}}
<!-- Example: Languages: TypeScript/Node.js (team expertise), Database: PostgreSQL 12 (upgrade planned Q2 2025), Cloud: AWS only (company standard), API: RESTful (no GraphQL this release), Legacy integration: SAP SOAP API (max 10 req/sec) -->

### 5.2 Regulatory Constraints
{{REGULATORY_CONSTRAINTS}}
<!-- Example: GDPR (EU users): Right to erasure, data portability. PCI DSS (payment): Cannot store CVV, encrypted card data. SOC 2: Annual audit required. Data residency: EU data must stay in eu-central-1 region -->

---

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

### 6.1 Assumptions
{{ASSUMPTIONS}}
<!-- Example: 1. Users have stable internet (>1 Mbps), 2. Third-party APIs (Stripe, SendGrid) maintain 99.9% uptime, 3. Team size remains 11 people through Year 1, 4. AWS infrastructure scales as needed, 5. Users accept cookies (session management) -->

### 6.2 Dependencies
{{DEPENDENCIES}}
<!-- Example: 1. Stripe API (payment processing), 2. SendGrid API (email delivery), 3. AWS services (ECS, RDS, S3, CloudFront), 4. Salesforce integration (customer sync), 5. DNS provider (Route 53), 6. SSL certificates (ACM) -->

## 7. Requirements Traceability

| Requirement ID | Epic | User Story | Test Case | Status |
|---------------|------|------------|-----------|--------|
| FR-UM-001 | Epic-001 | US-001 | TC-001 | {{STATUS}} |
<!-- Example: FR-UM-001 (User Registration) | EP-1 User Management | US-1 Email signup | TC-1 Register with valid email | Implemented -->

---

## 8. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| {{TERM_1}} | {{DEFINITION_1}} |
<!-- Example: SLA | Service Level Agreement - contractual uptime commitment (99.9%) | MTTR | Mean Time To Recovery - average time to restore service after failure | p95 | 95th percentile - 95% of requests faster than this value -->
