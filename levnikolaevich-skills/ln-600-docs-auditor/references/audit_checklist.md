# Documentation Audit Checklist

<!-- SCOPE: Documentation audit check rules ONLY. Contains per-category checks, fundamental principle (fix content not rules). -->
<!-- DO NOT add here: Size limits → size_limits.md, audit workflow → ln-600-docs-auditor SKILL.md -->

Detailed checks per category.

## ⚠️ Fundamental Principle

**Fix content, not rules.** When files violate limits/standards:
- ✅ Reduce file size (split, compress, extract)
- ✅ Fix formatting issues
- ✅ Remove duplication
- ❌ NEVER change limits in *_standards.md
- ❌ NEVER relax rules to make violations pass

This is non-negotiable. Changing rules instead of fixing content is forbidden.

## 1. Hierarchy & Links

### Must Pass
- [ ] CLAUDE.md exists at project root
- [ ] CLAUDE.md links to all primary docs (README, docs/*)
- [ ] All docs in docs/ reachable from CLAUDE.md (max 2 hops)
- [ ] No broken internal links (404)
- [ ] No orphaned .md files (unreachable from CLAUDE.md)

### Should Pass
- [ ] Consistent link format (relative paths)
- [ ] Links use descriptive text (not "click here")
- [ ] Bidirectional links for related docs
- [ ] TOC in files >100 lines

### Scoring
- 10/10: All checks pass
- -1 per broken link
- -2 per orphaned file
- -3 if CLAUDE.md missing or doesn't link to docs/

---

## 2. Single Source of Truth (SSOT)

### Must Pass
- [ ] No identical paragraphs across files
- [ ] No copy-pasted sections
- [ ] Shared concepts defined in one place with links elsewhere
- [ ] Clear ownership: each concept has one authoritative source

### Should Pass
- [ ] Cross-references use links, not inline copies
- [ ] Definitions not repeated (link to glossary/source)
- [ ] Version numbers in one place only
- [ ] Config examples not duplicated

### Detection Patterns
- Same paragraph in multiple files
- Similar tables with same data
- Repeated code examples
- Same list items in different docs

### Scoring
- 10/10: No duplication
- -1 per minor duplication (<50 words)
- -2 per major duplication (>50 words)
- -3 per full section copy

---

## 3. Proactive Compression

**Goal:** Minimum viable size - smallest document that fully conveys information.
Size limits are upper bounds, NOT targets. A 100-line file instead of 300 = success!

### Must Pass
- [ ] **All files checked for compression** (even under-limit ones!)
- [ ] No filler words (simply, easily, basically, actually, really, very)
- [ ] No obvious statements ("This section describes...")
- [ ] No over-explanations (one concept = one sentence max)
- [ ] Comparisons converted to tables
- [ ] Enumerations converted to lists
- [ ] Active voice used (not passive)

### Compression Targets

| Content Type | Before | After | Technique |
|--------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Comparison prose | "X is better than Y because..." | Table: X vs Y | prose→table |
| Long explanation | 5 sentences | 1-2 sentences | remove filler |
| Obvious statement | "This function does X" | (delete) | remove obvious |
| Repeated info | same info in 3 places | 1 place + links | SSOT |
| Verbose phrase | "in order to" | "to" | compress |

### Meaningless Content Patterns (DELETE)
- "This section describes/explains..."
- "As mentioned above/below..."
- "It is important to note that..."
- "Please note that..."
- "In this document, we will..."
- "The purpose of this is to..."

### Detection Patterns
- Verbose phrases (in order to → to, at this point → now)
- Long paragraphs (>3 sentences)
- Over-explained obvious concepts
- Prose comparisons: "X is better than Y", "compared to"
- Prose enumerations: "First..., Second...", "Additionally..."

### Scoring
- 10/10: Maximum compression achieved; no further reduction possible
- 8-9/10: Minor compression opportunities remain
- 6-7/10: Moderate compression possible (verbose sections, some prose→tables)
- 4-5/10: Significant compression needed (filler words, over-explanations)
- 1-3/10: Bloated content (major redundancy, meaningless sections)

**Note:** Being under size limit does NOT automatically mean 10/10.
A 150-line file with compression opportunities = 6/10.

---

## 4. Requirements Compliance

### Must Pass
- [ ] CLAUDE.md has: Repository section, Key Concepts, Important Details
- [ ] README.md has: About, Features, Installation, Usage
- [ ] SKILL.md has: YAML frontmatter (name, description), workflow, critical notes
- [ ] All docs end with single blank line (POSIX)
- [ ] **No code blocks in docs** - text descriptions only; code lives in codebase

### Should Pass
- [ ] Consistent heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- [ ] Tables properly formatted
- [ ] Callouts/admonitions for warnings

### No Code Policy

Documents describe algorithms and concepts in text, NOT code:
- ✅ "Function validates input, checks permissions, then processes request"
- ✅ "Loop iterates through items, filtering by status"
- ❌ `def process(item): ...` (code block)
- ❌ `for item in items: if item.status == 'active': ...`

**Exceptions:**
- CLI commands for installation/usage in README.md
- Config file snippets (YAML/JSON) when documenting configuration
- Shell commands for Quick Audit section

**Detection:** Search for triple backticks (```) with language tags (python, js, ts, etc.)

### Document-Specific Checks

| Document | Required Sections |
|----------|-------------------|
| CLAUDE.md | Repository, Key Concepts, Important Details |
| README.md | About, Features, Installation, Usage, License |
| SKILL.md | Frontmatter, Purpose, Workflow, Critical Notes, Version |
| Guide | Purpose, Steps, Examples, Troubleshooting |
| ADR | Context, Decision, Consequences |

### Scoring
- 10/10: All required sections present, no code blocks
- -1 per missing optional section
- -2 per missing required section
- -2 per code block in doc (except allowed exceptions)
- -3 per malformed document structure

---

## 5. Actuality (CRITICAL)

**Outdated docs are worse than no docs** - they mislead and waste time.
This category requires **active verification against code**, not passive reading.

### Must Pass - Verify Against Code
- [ ] **File paths** - every path in docs exists in codebase
- [ ] **Function/class names** - match actual code signatures
- [ ] **API endpoints** - exist and match described behavior
- [ ] **Config keys** - exist in actual config files/schemas
- [ ] **Environment variables** - match what code actually reads
- [ ] **Command examples** - run successfully (test them!)
- [ ] **Dependencies** - versions match package.json/requirements.txt

### Verification Workflow

For each doc, actively check:

| Doc Content | How to Verify |
|-------------|---------------|
| File path `src/utils/helper.ts` | `ls src/utils/helper.ts` |
| Function `processData(input)` | `grep -n "processData" src/` |
| Endpoint `POST /api/users` | Check router/controller files |
| Config `DATABASE_URL` | `grep -rn "DATABASE_URL" src/` |
| Command `npm run build` | Check package.json scripts |

### Fact-Check Patterns

**High-risk areas** (check first):
- Installation/setup instructions
- API documentation
- Configuration guides
- Architecture diagrams
- Dependency lists

**Detection of stale content:**
- Paths to deleted files
- References to renamed functions/classes
- Deprecated API endpoints still documented
- Old env var names
- Outdated version numbers

### Code vs Docs Priority
When mismatch found:
1. **Code is truth** - always update doc, never "fix" code to match doc
2. Report: "Doc says X, code does Y" with file:line reference
3. Action: "Update doc to reflect current code behavior"

### Scoring
- 10/10: All facts verified against code; docs match reality
- 8-9/10: Minor mismatches (typos in names, formatting)
- 6-7/10: Some paths/names outdated but core info correct
- 4-5/10: Functional mismatches (wrong behavior described)
- 1-3/10: Critical mismatches (setup fails, API wrong, config broken)
- -3 per critical mismatch (security, breaking changes)

---

## 6. Legacy Cleanup

### Must Pass
- [ ] No "History" or "Changelog" sections in docs (use CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] No "was previously", "used to be" language
- [ ] No commented-out documentation
- [ ] No deprecated feature documentation without removal date

### Should Pass
- [ ] No TODO comments in docs older than 30 days
- [ ] No references to removed features
- [ ] No migration guides for completed migrations
- [ ] No "temporary" notes that are permanent

### Detection Patterns
- "In version X.Y, we changed..."
- "Previously, this was..."
- "TODO: update this section"
- "Legacy: kept for backward compatibility"
- Dates more than 6 months old in inline notes

### Scoring
- 10/10: Current state only
- -1 per legacy note
- -2 per deprecated section kept
- -3 per major outdated documentation

## Quick Audit Commands

```bash
# === ACTUALITY VERIFICATION (run these first!) ===

# Extract all file paths from docs and check if they exist
grep -roh 'src/[^)` ]*\|lib/[^)` ]*' docs/ | sort -u | while read f; do [ ! -e "$f" ] && echo "MISSING: $f"; done

# Extract function/class names and verify they exist
grep -roh '\b[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*\b' docs/ | sort -u | head -20  # then grep in src/

# Check if documented env vars exist in code
grep -roh '\$[A-Z_]*\|[A-Z_]*=' docs/ | sort -u | while read v; do grep -rq "$v" src/ || echo "NOT FOUND: $v"; done

# Verify npm scripts mentioned in docs
grep -oh 'npm run [a-z-]*' docs/*.md | sort -u  # compare with package.json

# === STRUCTURE & LINKS ===

# Find orphaned files (files not linked from any other)
grep -rL "filename.md" docs/

# Find broken links
grep -roh '\[.*\](.*\.md)' docs/ | grep -v http

# === COMPRESSION ===

# Find verbose phrases
grep -rni "in order to\|at this point\|has the ability" docs/

# Find code blocks (should be minimal in docs)
grep -rn '```python\|```js\|```ts\|```java\|```go\|```rust' docs/

# Check file sizes
wc -l docs/**/*.md | sort -n

# === LEGACY ===

# Find TODO comments
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" docs/
```
