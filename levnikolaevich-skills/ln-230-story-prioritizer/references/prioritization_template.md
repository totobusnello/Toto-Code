## Strategy Decision Matrix

| Strategy | When to Use | Competition + RICE |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **BUILD** | Blue Ocean, monopoly opportunity | Competition 1-2, any RICE |
| **PARTNER** | Growing market, integrate via API | Competition 3, RICE < 15 |
| **BUY** | Commodity, use existing solution | Competition 4-5, RICE >= 15 |
| **IGNORE** | No differentiation, low value | Competition 5, RICE < 15 |

### Strategy Selection Rules

| Competition | RICE >= 15 | RICE < 15 |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 1-2 Blue Ocean | BUILD (priority P0) | BUILD (priority P1) |
| 3 Growing | BUILD or PARTNER | PARTNER |
| 4 Mature | PARTNER or BUY | BUY |
| 5 Red Ocean | BUY (table stakes) | IGNORE |

**Strategy Abbreviations in Table:**
- **B** = BUILD (develop in-house)
- **P** = PARTNER (integrate via API/SDK)
- **I** = BUY/INTEGRATE (use existing solution)
- **X** = IGNORE (defer or cut)

## Next Steps

1. **Review with stakeholders** - Validate priorities with product/business team
2. **Run ln-300** for P0/P1 Stories first - Focus engineering on highest value
3. **Consider cutting P3 Stories** - Move to future Epic or backlog
4. **Update this table** when requirements change - Re-run ln-230
