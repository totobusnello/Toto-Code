# Reference Documentation Questions

<!-- SCOPE: Interactive questions for reference docs (ADRs, Guides, Manuals) ONLY. Contains validation heuristics, auto-discovery hints. -->

**Purpose:** Define what each section of reference documentation should answer.

**Format:** Question → Expected Content → Validation Heuristics → Auto-Discovery Hints → MCP Ref Hints

<!-- DOCUMENT_START: ADR Documents -->
## ADR Documents

**Files:** docs/reference/adrs/adr-{NNN}-{topic}.md
**Template:** references/templates/adr_template.md
**Created By:** Phase 2 Smart Document Creation (if justified)

**Rules for ADR documents:**
- Only created for nontrivial technology choices (see tech_justification_rules.md)
- Must explain WHY decision was needed, not just WHAT was chosen
- Must list alternatives that were actually considered

---

<!-- QUESTION_START: 4 -->
### Question 4: Does ADR explain WHY this decision was needed?

**Expected Answer:** Context section with problem statement, constraints, forces driving the decision
**Target Section:** ## Context

**Validation Heuristics:**
- Contains "Context" or "Problem" section
- Explains WHAT problem existed (not just "we needed X")
- Mentions constraints or forces (time, team, compatibility, etc.)
- Length > 40 words in Context section
- NO generic statements like "We needed to choose a framework"

**Auto-Discovery:**
- Check TECH_STACK for detected technology
- Scan package.json for related dependencies (integration constraints)
- Check README.md for project requirements that influenced choice

**Anti-Patterns (reject if found):**
- "We decided to use X" without explaining why X was needed
- Generic context: "Modern applications need..."
- Missing problem statement
<!-- QUESTION_END: 4 -->

---

<!-- QUESTION_START: 5 -->
### Question 5: Does ADR list alternatives with pros/cons?

**Expected Answer:** Table or list of 2+ alternatives with specific pros/cons for each
**Target Section:** ## Alternatives Considered

**Validation Heuristics:**
- Has "Alternatives" section
- Lists at least 2 alternatives (including rejected ones)
- Each alternative has pros AND cons (not just cons for rejected)
- Includes "Why Rejected" reasoning
- NO empty or placeholder alternatives

**Auto-Discovery:**
- Detect technology category (frontend/backend/orm/etc.)
- List common alternatives in that category
- Check if alternatives were in package.json history (git log)

**Anti-Patterns (reject if found):**
- Only 1 alternative listed
- Alternatives without pros (biased toward chosen)
- Generic pros/cons: "popular", "easy to use", "well-documented"
- Placeholder: "Alternative 1", "Alternative 2"
<!-- QUESTION_END: 5 -->

---

**Overall ADR Validation:**
- Has SCOPE tag in first 10 lines
- Has Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences, Alternatives sections
- Context explains problem (not just "we needed X")
- Alternatives section has 2+ real options

<!-- DOCUMENT_START: Guide Documents -->
## Guide Documents

**Files:** docs/reference/guides/guide-{topic}.md
**Template:** references/templates/guide_template.md
**Created By:** Phase 2 Smart Document Creation (if justified)

**Rules for Guide documents:**
- Only created when complex configuration or custom patterns detected
- Must document project-specific patterns, not generic best practices
- Focus on "Our Implementation" vs generic industry patterns

---

<!-- QUESTION_START: 6 -->
### Question 6: Does Guide have project-specific patterns?

**Expected Answer:** "Our Implementation" section with concrete examples from THIS project, not generic patterns
**Target Section:** ## Our Implementation

**Validation Heuristics:**
- Contains "Our Implementation" or "Project-Specific" section
- References actual file paths from the project (`src/`, `lib/`, etc.)
- Shows code patterns with project's naming conventions
- Patterns table has "When to Use" column with project context
- Length > 50 words in Our Implementation section

**Auto-Discovery:**
- Scan project for pattern usage (grep for hooks, middleware, decorators)
- Extract real file paths where pattern is used
- Identify project naming conventions from existing code

**Anti-Patterns (reject if found):**
- Generic patterns without project context
- Copy-pasted examples from official docs
- No file path references to actual project code
- Generic "When to Use": "when you need to..."
<!-- QUESTION_END: 6 -->

---

**Overall Guide Validation:**

<!-- DOCUMENT_START: Manual Documents -->
## Manual Documents

**Files:** docs/reference/manuals/manual-{package}-{version}.md
**Template:** references/templates/manual_template.md
**Created By:** Phase 2 Smart Document Creation (if justified)

**Rules for Manual documents:**
- Only created for complex APIs or version-specific behavior
- Must document methods WE ACTUALLY USE, not full API
- Include version-specific notes and known limitations

---

<!-- QUESTION_START: 7 -->
### Question 7: Does Manual document version-specific behavior?

**Expected Answer:** Version number in title, version-specific notes section, known limitations for this version
**Target Section:** ## Version-Specific Notes, ## Known Limitations

**Validation Heuristics:**
- Title includes version number (e.g., "Prisma 5.0 Manual")
- Has "Version-Specific Notes" section
- Lists known limitations or breaking changes
- Documents methods "We Use" (not full API dump)
- Installation command includes version constraint

**Auto-Discovery:**
- Parse package.json for exact version
- Check package CHANGELOG for breaking changes
- Scan codebase for actually used methods (import analysis)

**Anti-Patterns (reject if found):**
- No version in title
- Full API documentation (should focus on what WE use)
- Generic limitations: "may have bugs"
- Copy-pasted from official docs without project context
<!-- QUESTION_END: 7 -->

---

**Overall Manual Validation:**
- Has SCOPE tag in first 10 lines
