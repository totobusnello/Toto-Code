## 🎯 Use Cases

### Quick Fix

```
# Fix typo in skill
[Edit file]
/review              # Quick check
/git:cp              # Commit + push
```

### New Skill Addition

```
# Create new skill
[Create skill directory and files]
/review              # Validate structure
/security-scan       # Check for issues
/git:cm              # Commit locally
[Test skill activation]
/git:cp              # Push when ready
/git:pr              # Create PR for review
```

### Major Feature with Multiple Skills

```
# Work on branch
git checkout -b feature/enterprise-skills

# Add multiple skills
[Create skill 1]
/git:cm

[Create skill 2]
/git:cm

[Create skill 3]
/git:cm

# Final quality check
/review
/security-scan

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/enterprise-skills
/git:pr

# Or use /git:cp if you want to push single commit
```

---

## 🚨 Emergency Bypass

### Skip Reviews (Emergency Only)

If you need to bypass checks:

```bash
# Method 1: Use --no-verify flag
git push --no-verify

# Method 2: PR title bypass
[EMERGENCY] Fix critical bug

# Method 3: PR label
Add label: emergency, skip-review, or hotfix
```

**Note**: These bypass automated reviews but manual review is still recommended.
