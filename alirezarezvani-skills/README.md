## 🏗️ Skill Architecture

Each skill package follows a consistent, modular structure:

```
{skill-category}/
└── {skill-name}/
    ├── SKILL.md                          # Master documentation
    ├── scripts/                          # Python CLI tools
    │   ├── {tool_name}.py               # Executable analysis tools
    │   └── ...
    ├── references/                       # Knowledge bases
    │   ├── {framework_name}.md          # Curated guidelines
    │   └── ...
    └── assets/                           # User templates
        ├── {template_name}.md           # Ready-to-use templates
        └── ...
```

### Design Principles

1. **Self-Contained** - Each skill is fully independent and deployable
2. **Documentation-Driven** - Success depends on clear, actionable documentation
3. **Algorithm Over AI** - Use deterministic analysis (code) when possible for speed and reliability
4. **Template-Heavy** - Provide ready-to-use frameworks users can customize
5. **Platform-Specific** - Focus on specific, actionable advice over generic best practices

### Component Responsibilities

| Component | Purpose | Format |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **SKILL.md** | Entry point, workflows, usage instructions | Markdown |
| **scripts/** | Automated analysis and optimization tools | Python CLI |
| **references/** | Expert knowledge, frameworks, guidelines | Markdown |
| **assets/** | Templates for end-user customization | Markdown/YAML |

# 1. Identifies top 10 debt items by severity
# 2. Estimates effort to address (hours/days)
# 3. Calculates impact on velocity
# 4. Generates prioritized roadmap
# 5. Creates Jira tickets with detailed descriptions
