# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This is a **comprehensive skills library** for Claude AI - reusable, production-ready skill packages that bundle domain expertise, best practices, analysis tools, and strategic frameworks. The repository provides modular skills that teams can download and use directly in their workflows.

**Current Scope:** 48 production-ready skills across 6 domains with 68+ Python automation tools.

**Key Distinction**: This is NOT a traditional application. It's a library of skill packages meant to be extracted and deployed by users into their own Claude workflows.

## Architecture Overview

### Repository Structure

```
claude-code-skills/
├── agents/                    # cs-* prefixed agents (in development)
├── marketing-skill/           # 5 marketing skills + Python tools
├── product-team/              # 5 product skills + Python tools
├── engineering-team/          # 18 engineering skills + Python tools
├── c-level-advisor/           # 2 C-level skills
├── project-management/        # 6 PM skills + Atlassian MCP
├── ra-qm-team/                # 12 RA/QM compliance skills
├── standards/                 # 5 standards library files
├── templates/                 # Reusable templates
└── documentation/             # Implementation plans, sprints, delivery
```

### Skill Package Pattern

Each skill follows this structure:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Master documentation
├── scripts/              # Python CLI tools (no ML/LLM calls)
├── references/           # Expert knowledge bases
└── assets/               # User templates
```

**Design Philosophy**: Skills are self-contained packages. Each includes executable tools (Python scripts), knowledge bases (markdown references), and user-facing templates. Teams can extract a skill folder and use it immediately.

**Key Pattern**: Knowledge flows from `references/` → into `SKILL.md` workflows → executed via `scripts/` → applied using `assets/` templates.

## Git Workflow

**Branch Strategy:** feature → dev → main (PR only)

**Branch Protection Active:** Main branch requires PR approval. Direct pushes blocked.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Always start from dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/agents-{name}

# 3. Work and commit (conventional commits)
feat(agents): implement cs-{agent-name}
fix(tool): correct calculation logic
docs(workflow): update branch strategy

# 4. Push and create PR to dev
git push origin feature/agents-{name}
gh pr create --base dev --head feature/agents-{name}

# 5. After approval, PR merges to dev
# 6. Periodically, dev merges to main via PR
```

**Branch Protection Rules:**
- ✅ Main: Requires PR approval, no direct push
- ✅ Dev: Unprotected, but PRs recommended
- ✅ All: Conventional commits enforced

See [documentation/WORKFLOW.md](documentation/WORKFLOW.md) for complete workflow guide.
See [standards/git/git-workflow-standards.md](standards/git/git-workflow-standards.md) for commit standards.

## Development Environment

**No build system or test frameworks** - intentional design choice for portability.

**Python Scripts:**
- Use standard library only (minimal dependencies)
- CLI-first design for easy automation
- Support both JSON and human-readable output
- No ML/LLM calls (keeps skills portable and fast)

**If adding dependencies:**
- Keep scripts runnable with minimal setup (`pip install package` at most)
- Document all dependencies in SKILL.md
- Prefer standard library implementations

## Current Sprint

**Active Sprint:** sprint-11-05-2025 (Nov 5-19, 2025)
**Goal:** Skill-Agent Integration Phase 1-2
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All 6 days finished, 5 agents deployed

**Deliverables:**
- 5 production agents: cs-content-creator, cs-demand-gen-specialist, cs-ceo-advisor, cs-cto-advisor, cs-product-manager
- 1 agent template for future development
- Modular documentation structure (main + 9 domain CLAUDE.md files)
- Branch protection and workflow documentation

**Progress Tracking:**
- [Sprint Plan](documentation/delivery/sprint-11-05-2025/plan.md) - Day-by-day execution plan
- [Sprint Context](documentation/delivery/sprint-11-05-2025/context.md) - Goals, scope, risks
- [Sprint Progress](documentation/delivery/sprint-11-05-2025/PROGRESS.md) - Real-time auto-updating tracker

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 Complete:** 48 production-ready skills deployed
- Marketing (5), C-Level (2), Product (5), PM (6), Engineering (18), RA/QM (12)
- 68+ Python automation tools, 90+ reference guides
- Complete enterprise coverage from marketing through regulatory compliance

**Next Priorities:**
- **Phase 2 (Q1 2026):** Marketing expansion - SEO optimizer, social media manager, campaign analytics
- **Phase 3 (Q2 2026):** Business & growth - Sales engineer, customer success, growth marketer
- **Phase 4 (Q3 2026):** Specialized domains - Mobile, blockchain, web3, finance

**Target:** 50+ skills by Q3 2026

See domain-specific roadmaps in each skill folder's README.md or roadmap files.

## Key Principles

1. **Skills are products** - Each skill deployable as standalone package
2. **Documentation-driven** - Success depends on clear, actionable docs
3. **Algorithm over AI** - Use deterministic analysis (code) vs LLM calls
4. **Template-heavy** - Provide ready-to-use templates users customize
5. **Platform-specific** - Specific best practices > generic advice

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Creating dependencies between skills (keep each self-contained)
- Adding complex build systems or test frameworks (maintain simplicity)
- Generic advice (focus on specific, actionable frameworks)
- LLM calls in scripts (defeats portability and speed)
- Over-documenting file structure (skills are simple by design)

## Working with This Repository

**Creating New Skills:** Follow the appropriate domain's roadmap and CLAUDE.md guide (see Navigation Map above).

**Editing Existing Skills:** Maintain consistency across markdown files. Use the same voice, formatting, and structure patterns.

**Quality Standard:** Each skill should save users 40%+ time while improving consistency/quality by 30%+.
