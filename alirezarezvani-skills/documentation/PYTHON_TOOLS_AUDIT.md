## ⚠️ Issues Found

### Issue 1: RA/QM Skills Have Placeholder Scripts

**Problem:** 11 out of 12 RA/QM skills have placeholder "example.py" scripts (19 lines each).

**Affected Skills:**
1. capa-officer
2. fda-consultant-specialist
3. gdpr-dsgvo-expert
4. information-security-manager-iso27001
5. isms-audit-expert
6. mdr-745-specialist
7. qms-audit-expert
8. quality-documentation-manager
9. quality-manager-qmr
10. quality-manager-qms-iso13485
11. risk-management-specialist

**Exception:** regulatory-affairs-head has production script (regulatory_tracker.py - 199 lines)

**Impact:**
- Documentation claims "36 Python tools" for RA/QM, but only 1 is production-ready
- Skills are still valuable (comprehensive SKILL.md content), but automation is limited

**Recommendations:**
1. **Option A:** Remove placeholder scripts, update documentation to reflect "documentation-focused skills"
2. **Option B:** Develop production Python tools for each RA/QM skill (high effort)
3. **Option C:** Keep placeholders, update docs to say "scripts planned for v2.0"

---

### Issue 2: Engineering Skills Need Verification

**Status:** Scripts exist but haven't been fully verified for production readiness.

**Engineering Core (27 scripts):**
- Most appear to be ~100 lines (based on wc output)
- Need to verify they're production code vs placeholders

**Engineering AI/ML (15 scripts):**
- Similar size pattern (~100 lines)
- Need verification

**Recommendation:** Spot-check a few engineering scripts to verify quality.

---

### Issue 3: Six Undocumented Skills Found (RESOLVED)

**Discovery (November 7, 2025):** 6 skills exist but were not documented in README.md

**New Marketing Skills (2):**
- `app-store-optimization` - 5+ Python tools for ASO
- `social-media-analyzer` - 3+ Python tools for social analytics

**New Engineering Skills (4):**
- `aws-solution-architect` - 2+ Python tools for AWS architecture
- `ms365-tenant-manager` - 2+ Python tools for M365 admin
- `tdd-guide` - 1+ Python tool for test coverage
- `tech-stack-evaluator` - 1+ Python tool for stack evaluation

**Resolution:**
- ✅ README.md updated with all 6 skills (November 7, 2025)
- ✅ Skill counts corrected: 42 → 48
- ✅ Domain counts updated: Marketing (3→5), Engineering (9→13)
- ✅ This audit updated to reflect new discoveries

## 📈 Corrected Tool Count

### Actual Production-Ready Python Tools

**Confirmed Production (November 7, 2025 Update):**
- Marketing: 11+ tools (5 original + 6 new from ASO and Social Media)
- C-Level: 4 tools
- Product: 5 tools
- Engineering: 8+ new tools (AWS, MS365, TDD, Tech Stack)
- Engineering Core: Need verification (~35 tools claimed)
- Engineering AI/ML: Need verification (~15 tools claimed)
- RA/QM: 1 tool (11 are placeholders)

**Total Verified Production Tools:** ~29-31 confirmed (up from 18-20)

**Total Scripts (including placeholders):** 81+ files (up from 69)

**Total Production Tools (if engineering verified):** ~68-70 tools

---

## 🔧 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (High Priority)

**1. Update Documentation for RA/QM Skills**

Current claim:
```
- **36 Python automation tools** (12 skills × 3 tools per skill)
```

Accurate statement:
```
- **1 production Python tool + 11 placeholder scripts** for future development
- Skills provide comprehensive regulatory/quality expertise through documentation
- Python automation planned for v2.0
```

**2. Verify Engineering Scripts**

Check if engineering scripts are production-ready or placeholders:
```bash
# Sample a few scripts
cat ./engineering-team/senior-frontend/scripts/component_generator.py | head -50
cat ./engineering-team/senior-backend/scripts/api_scaffolder.py | head -50
```

**3. Document or Remove medium-content-pro**

Decision needed:
- Add to main documentation as 43rd skill?
- Move to separate repository?
- Mark as experimental/beta?

---

### Medium Priority

**1. Develop Production Scripts for RA/QM**

For high-value skills, develop real Python tools:
- **qms_compliance_checker.py** for QMS ISO 13485 skill
- **mdr_compliance_checker.py** for MDR specialist
- **fda_submission_packager.py** for FDA consultant
- **capa_tracker.py** for CAPA officer
- **risk_register_manager.py** for Risk Management specialist

**2. Create Script Development Plan**

Prioritize based on user value:
1. Most used skills get tools first
2. Tools that provide highest automation value
3. Complex compliance checking (high manual effort)
