- git repository is initialized

**Success Guarantee** (Postcondition):
- One development task completed
- Files modified and committed (if changes made)
- Status tracked in logs and status.json
- Circuit breaker state updated
- Exit signals analyzed and recorded

**Main Success Scenario**:
1. Ralph reads PROMPT.md
2. Ralph checks circuit breaker state (must be CLOSED or HALF_OPEN)
3. Ralph verifies rate limit allows execution
4. Ralph executes Claude Code with PROMPT.md
5. Claude Code reads fix_plan.md and selects task
6. Claude Code implements task (files modified)
7. Claude Code runs relevant tests
8. Claude Code outputs RALPH_STATUS block
9. Ralph analyzes Claude's response (analyze_response)
10. Ralph updates .exit_signals file (update_exit_signals)
11. Ralph records loop result in circuit breaker (record_loop_result)
12. Ralph increments call counter
13. Ralph logs completion to status.json and logs/
14. Ralph continues to next loop (if no exit condition)

**Extensions** (Alternative Flows):

**2a. Circuit breaker is OPEN**:
- 2a1. Ralph displays circuit breaker status
- 2a2. Ralph shows user guidance (check logs, reset, etc.)
- 2a3. Ralph exits with exit code 1
- USE CASE ENDS

**3a. Rate limit exceeded**:
- 3a1. Ralph calculates time until next hour reset
- 3a2. Ralph displays countdown timer
- 3a3. Ralph waits for reset
- 3a4. Ralph continues at step 4

**3b. API 5-hour limit reached**:
- 3b1. Ralph detects "rate limit" error in Claude output
- 3b2. Ralph prompts user: retry or exit?
- 3b3a. User chooses retry: wait 5 minutes, go to step 4
- 3b3b. User chooses exit: Ralph exits gracefully
- USE CASE ENDS

**4a. Claude Code execution fails**:
- 4a1. Ralph logs error to logs/ralph_error.log
- 4a2. Ralph updates status.json with "failed" status
- 4a3. Ralph continues to next loop (retry)
- 4a4. If 5 consecutive failures: circuit breaker opens
- Continue at step 2

**9a. Response analysis detects EXIT_SIGNAL=true**:
- 9a1. Ralph logs successful completion
- 9a2. Ralph updates status.json with "complete" status
- 9a3. Ralph displays completion summary
- 9a4. Ralph exits with exit code 0
- USE CASE ENDS

**11a. Circuit breaker opens (no progress detected)**:
- 11a1. Ralph logs circuit breaker opening
- 11a2. Ralph updates status.json with "circuit_open" status
- 11a3. Ralph displays guidance to user
- 11a4. Ralph exits with exit code 1
- USE CASE ENDS

**Frequency**: Occurs in loop until completion or exit condition
**Performance**: Each loop should complete in < 5 minutes under normal conditions

---

## UC-2: Detect Project Completion

**Primary Actor**: Ralph (via response_analyzer.sh)
**Stakeholders**: Human Developer (wants reliable exit), Claude Code (signals completion)
**Preconditions**:
- Development loop has executed (UC-1)
- Claude Code has produced output

**Success Guarantee**:
- Completion status accurately determined
- .exit_signals file updated with decision
- Confidence score calculated (0-100+)
- EXIT_SIGNAL set correctly (true/false)

**Main Success Scenario**:
1. Ralph reads Claude Code output file
2. Ralph checks for structured RALPH_STATUS block
3. Ralph finds STATUS: COMPLETE and EXIT_SIGNAL: true
4. Ralph sets confidence score to 100
5. Ralph sets exit_signal to true in .response_analysis
6. Ralph updates .exit_signals with done_signals array
7. Ralph triggers graceful exit in next loop check

**Extensions**:

**2a. No structured output found**:
- 2a1. Ralph searches for natural language completion keywords
- 2a2. If found: add +10 to confidence score
- 2a3. Ralph checks for "nothing to do" patterns
- 2a4. If found: add +15 to confidence score, set exit_signal=true
- Continue at step 6

**3a. STATUS shows IN_PROGRESS**:
- 3a1. Ralph checks WORK_TYPE field
- 3a2. If WORK_TYPE=TESTING for 3rd consecutive loop: mark as test_only
- 3a3. If FILES_MODIFIED=0 for 3rd consecutive loop: circuit breaker opens
- 3a4. Set exit_signal to false
- Continue at step 6

**3b. STATUS shows BLOCKED**:
- 3b1. Ralph increments blocked_loops counter
- 3b2. If blocked_loops >= 3: recommend human intervention
- 3b3. Set exit_signal to false
- Continue at step 6

**6a. Confidence score >= 40**:
- 6a1. Even without explicit EXIT_SIGNAL, set exit_signal=true
- 6a2. Log high confidence completion detection
- Continue at step 7

**Frequency**: After every development loop
**Performance**: Analysis should complete in < 1 second

## UC-3: Prevent Resource Waste (Circuit Breaker)

**Primary Actor**: Ralph (via circuit_breaker.sh)
**Stakeholders**: Human Developer (wants to avoid token waste)
**Preconditions**:
- Development loops are executing
- Circuit breaker is initialized

**Success Guarantee**:
- Runaway loops detected and halted
- Token waste minimized (< 1K wasted tokens)
- Clear user guidance provided on halt
- Circuit breaker state persisted across restarts

**Main Success Scenario**:
1. Ralph initializes circuit breaker to CLOSED state
2. After each loop, Ralph calls record_loop_result()
3. Ralph counts files_changed from git diff
4. Ralph detects has_errors from Claude output
5. Ralph calculates output_length
6. Circuit breaker updates consecutive_no_progress counter
7. consecutive_no_progress is 0 (progress detected)
8. Circuit breaker stays CLOSED
9. Ralph continues to next loop

**Extensions**:

**6a. No files changed (consecutive_no_progress increments)**:
- 6a1. consecutive_no_progress = 1
- 6a2. Circuit breaker stays CLOSED
- Continue at step 9

**6b. No files changed for 2nd consecutive loop**:
- 6b1. consecutive_no_progress = 2
- 6b2. Circuit breaker transitions to HALF_OPEN
- 6b3. Ralph logs "monitoring mode" warning
- Continue at step 9

**6c. No files changed for 3rd consecutive loop**:
- 6c1. consecutive_no_progress = 3
- 6c2. Circuit breaker transitions to OPEN
- 6c3. Ralph displays halt message with guidance
- 6c4. Ralph exits with exit code 1
- USE CASE ENDS

**6d. Same error detected for 5th consecutive loop**:
- 6d1. consecutive_same_error = 5
- 6d2. Circuit breaker transitions to OPEN
- 6d3. Reason: "Same error repeated in 5 consecutive loops"
- Continue at step 6c3

**7a. Files changed detected (recovery)**:
- 7a1. consecutive_no_progress resets to 0
- 7a2. If circuit was HALF_OPEN: transition to CLOSED
- 7a3. Ralph logs "circuit recovered"
- Continue at step 9

**Frequency**: After every development loop
**Performance**: Circuit breaker check < 100ms

## UC-4: Handle API Rate Limits

**Primary Actor**: Ralph
**Stakeholders**: Human Developer (wants uninterrupted execution)
**Preconditions**:
- Ralph is executing development loops
- Call tracking is initialized

2. Ralph reads .last_reset timestamp
3. Current hour matches last_reset (same hour)
4. Ralph reads .call_count
5. call_count is 45 (< 100 limit)
6. Ralph allows execution
7. Ralph increments call_count to 46
8. Ralph writes updated count to .call_count
9. Execution proceeds

**Extensions**:

**3a. New hour detected (hour changed)**:
- 3a1. Ralph resets call_count to 0
- 3a2. Ralph writes current hour to .last_reset
- 3a3. Ralph logs "call counter reset for new hour"
- Continue at step 5

**5a. call_count equals or exceeds limit (100)**:
- 5a1. Ralph calculates seconds until next hour
- 5a2. Ralph displays countdown: "Rate limit reached. Waiting HH:MM:SS..."
- 5a3. Ralph sleeps for calculated duration
- 5a4. Ralph resets counter (go to step 3a1)
- Continue at step 6

**5b. Claude returns API rate limit error**:
- 5b1. Ralph detects "rate_limit_error" in output
- 5b2. Ralph prompts: "API 5-hour limit reached. Retry? (y/n)"
- 5b3a. User enters 'y': Ralph waits 5 minutes, retries
- 5b3b. User enters 'n': Ralph exits gracefully
- USE CASE ENDS

**Frequency**: Before every Claude Code execution
**Performance**: Rate limit check < 50ms

- 2a2. User checks .circuit_breaker_history for state transitions
- 2a3. User reviews recent Claude output files
- Continue at step 3

**3a. Issue is in PROMPT.md or specs/**:
