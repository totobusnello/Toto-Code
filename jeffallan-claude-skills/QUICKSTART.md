## Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

### 1. Provide Context
Include relevant information:
- Framework/language you're using
- What you're trying to accomplish
- Any constraints or requirements
- Error messages (if debugging)

### 2. Ask for Multiple Perspectives
```
"Review this authentication code for both security and performance issues"
[Activates: Security Reviewer + Code Reviewer]
```

### 3. Follow Recommended Workflows

**New Feature: Requirements → Design → Implement → Test → Review → Deploy**
1. Feature Forge (requirements)
2. Architecture Designer (design)
3. Fullstack Guardian + Framework Expert (implement)
4. Test Master + Playwright Expert (test)
5. Code Reviewer + Security Reviewer (review)
6. DevOps Engineer (deploy)
7. Monitoring Expert (observe)
