        ## Implementation Details (per CLAUDE.md)
        1. Check existing skills for overlap
        2. Create `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` (~80-100 lines):
           - Frontmatter: name, description (trigger-only!), triggers, role, scope, output-format
           - Core sections: Role Definition, When to Use, Core Workflow, Constraints (MUST DO/MUST NOT DO), Routing Table
        3. Create reference files in `skills/{skill-name}/references/` (100-600 lines each)
        4. Update SKILLS_GUIDE.md with new skill entry

        ## Acceptance Criteria
        - [ ] No overlap with existing skills verified
        - [ ] SKILL.md ~80-100 lines with all required sections
        - [ ] Description is TRIGGER-ONLY format: "Use when [conditions]" (NO process steps!)
        - [ ] Frontmatter complete: name, description, triggers, role, scope, output-format
        - [ ] Routing table links to reference files
        - [ ] Reference files 100-600 lines with complete code examples
        - [ ] MUST DO / MUST NOT DO constraints defined
        - [ ] Related skills cross-referenced
        - [ ] Added to SKILLS_GUIDE.md
