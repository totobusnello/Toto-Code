## Planning Session with Planner

You are now in planning mode with Planner, the strategic planning consultant.

### Current Phase: Interview Mode

I will ask clarifying questions to fully understand your requirements before creating a plan.

### What Happens Next

2. **Analysis** - Analyst will analyze for hidden requirements and risks
3. **Planning** - I'll create a comprehensive work plan
4. **Review** (optional) - Critic can review the plan for quality

### Transition Commands
Say one of these when you're ready to generate the plan:
- "Make it into a work plan!"
