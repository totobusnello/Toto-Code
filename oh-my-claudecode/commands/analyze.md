# Deep Analysis Mode

[ANALYSIS MODE ACTIVATED]

## Objective

Conduct thorough analysis of the specified target (code, architecture, issue, bug, performance bottleneck, security concern).

## Approach

1. **Gather Context**
   - Read relevant files
   - Check git history if relevant
   - Review related issues/PRs if applicable

2. **Analyze Systematically**
   - Identify patterns and antipatterns
   - Trace execution flows
   - Map dependencies and relationships
   - Check for edge cases

3. **Synthesize Findings**
   - Root cause (for bugs)
   - Design decisions and tradeoffs (for architecture)
   - Bottlenecks and hotspots (for performance)
   - Vulnerabilities and risks (for security)

4. **Provide Recommendations**
   - Concrete, actionable next steps
   - Prioritized by impact
   - Consider maintainability and technical debt

## Output Format

Present findings clearly:
- **Summary** (2-3 sentences)
- **Key Findings** (bulleted list)
- **Analysis** (detailed explanation)
- **Recommendations** (prioritized)

Stay objective. Cite file paths and line numbers. No speculation without evidence.
