  "description": "Automatically send Claude Code conversation traces to LangSmith for monitoring and analysis. Prerequisites: jq (brew install jq on macOS or sudo apt-get install jq on Linux), curl and uuidgen (usually pre-installed), LangSmith account and API key. Configuration: Install langsmith-tracing setting (npx claude-code-templates@latest --setting telemetry/langsmith-tracing) or manually add to .claude/settings.local.json the following environment variables: TRACE_TO_LANGSMITH=true, CC_LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_..., CC_LANGSMITH_PROJECT=project-name, CC_LANGSMITH_DEBUG=true (optional). How it works: Runs in background on Stop event after each Claude response, reads conversation transcript, converts to LangSmith format, sends to LangSmith API, groups by thread_id for session continuity. Debugging: Check logs at ~/.claude/state/hook.log. Privacy note: System prompts not included in traces.",
