# Ship-Learn-Next Action Planner

Transform passive learning into active doing. This skill converts YouTube transcripts, articles, tutorials, and other educational content into actionable **Ship-Learn-Next cycles** - concrete, shippable iterations that build real skills.

## Purpose

Most people consume educational content and never act on it. They watch tutorials, read articles, take courses - but never ship anything. This skill exists to break that cycle.

**The core principle**: 100 reps beats 100 hours of study. Learning = doing better, not knowing more.

Instead of creating study plans, this skill creates **ship plans** - structured iterations where you build something real, reflect honestly on what happened, and plan the next iteration based on actual experience.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when you:

- Have a transcript, article, or tutorial and want to **implement the advice**
- Want to **turn educational content into a plan** or "make this actionable"
- Need help **extracting implementation steps** from learning material
- Want to **break down big ideas** into small, shippable reps
- Find yourself saying "I watched/read X, now what should I do?"
- Have course notes and want to **start practicing immediately**

**Trigger phrases**:
- "Turn this into a plan"
- "Make this actionable"
- "I watched this video, now what?"
- "Help me implement this advice"
- "Create a learning quest from this"
- "What should I actually do with this?"

## How It Works

### The Ship-Learn-Next Framework

Every learning quest follows three repeating phases:

1. **SHIP** - Create something real (code, content, product, demonstration)
2. **LEARN** - Honest reflection on what happened
3. **NEXT** - Plan the next iteration based on learnings

This cycle repeats, with each "rep" building on the previous one.

### The Process

1. **Read the Content**: Provide your learning material (transcript, article, notes)
2. **Extract Core Lessons**: Identify actionable principles, not just theory
3. **Define Your Quest**: Frame a specific 4-8 week goal with concrete success criteria
4. **Design Rep 1**: Create the smallest shippable version you can complete this week
5. **Create the Rep Plan**: Structure action steps, success criteria, and reflection questions
6. **Map Future Reps**: Outline a progression path for reps 2-5

### What Makes a Good Rep

Each rep should be:
- **Concrete and specific** - "Ship one landing page by Friday" not "Learn web development"
- **Completable in 1-7 days** - Small enough to not be intimidating
- **Produces real evidence** - An artifact you can show
- **Big enough to learn** - Challenging enough to teach you something meaningful

## Key Features

- **Content Analysis**: Extracts actionable lessons from any educational content
- **Quest Framing**: Helps define specific, measurable goals
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each rep adds ONE new element
- **Built-in Reflection**: Structured questions after each shipped rep
- **Action Orientation**: Always ends with "what's next?"
- **Automatic Plan Saving**: Saves your complete quest plan as a Markdown file

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: YouTube Tutorial

```
User: I just watched a video about cold email outreach. Here's the transcript.
      [provides transcript file path]
      Help me actually implement this.

Skill: [Reads transcript, extracts key techniques, helps define quest]
       Based on this content, what would "success" look like for you in 6 weeks?

User: Getting 5 meetings booked from cold outreach.

Skill: [Creates Ship-Learn-Next plan with Rep 1: Send 10 cold emails this week]
```

### Example 2: Course Notes

```
User: I have notes from a React course. Turn this into something I can actually do.
      [provides notes file path]

Skill: What's ONE thing you want to build with React in the next month?

User: A personal portfolio site.

Skill: [Creates plan with Rep 1: Build and deploy a single-page "Hello World"
       portfolio with your name and one project by Friday]
```

### Example 3: Article Implementation

```
User: I read this article about building products in proven markets.
      [provides article content]
      Make this actionable for me.

Skill: [Extracts the 3-5 core actionable principles]
       What market are you interested in? What could you ship this week to test it?
```

## Prerequisites

- **Learning content**: A file containing the transcript, article, tutorial, or notes you want to implement
- **Willingness to ship**: This skill is for doing, not planning forever

No special tools or dependencies required.

## Output

The skill produces a complete **Ship-Learn-Next Quest Plan** saved as a Markdown file:

```
Ship-Learn-Next Plan - [Your Quest Title].md
```

### Plan Structure

```markdown
# Your Ship-Learn-Next Quest: [Title]

## Quest Overview
- Goal (4-8 week target)
- Source (content that inspired this)
- Core Lessons (3-5 actionable takeaways)

## Rep 1: [Specific, Shippable Goal]
- Ship Goal
- Timeline (this week)
- Success Criteria (checkboxes)
- What You'll Practice
- Action Steps
- Minimal Resources
- After Shipping - Reflection Questions

## Rep 2-5: Future Path
- Progressive iterations with increasing challenge
- Each rep adds ONE new element

## Remember
- Focus on doing, not studying
- Aim for 100 reps (not perfection on rep 1)
- You learn by shipping, not consuming
```

## Best Practices

### For Best Results

1. **Be specific about your goal**: "Learn sales" is too vague. "Get 2 responses from 10 cold outreach messages" is specific.

2. **Start smaller than you think**: Rep 1 should be embarrassingly small. You can always level up in Rep 2.

3. **Actually ship**: Don't just plan. Deploy, publish, share, demonstrate. Create real evidence.

4. **Reflect honestly**: After each rep, answer the reflection questions truthfully. This is where learning happens.

5. **Come back for Rep 2**: Return after shipping and the skill will help you plan the next iteration based on what you learned.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Don't plan forever**: Start shipping. Imperfect action beats perfect planning.
- **Don't consume more content**: The content you have is enough for Rep 1. Ship first, study later.
- **Don't aim for perfection**: This is rep 1 of 100. It's supposed to be rough.
- **Don't skip reflection**: The LEARN phase is where the magic happens.

## Philosophy

This skill is built on a simple truth: **you don't learn by consuming, you learn by doing**.

Every great practitioner got there through reps - hundreds of attempts, failures, iterations, and improvements. Not through watching tutorials.

The goal isn't to create the perfect plan. It's to help you ship something real, learn from it, and ship the next thing. Then the next. Then the next.

Let's help you ship.
