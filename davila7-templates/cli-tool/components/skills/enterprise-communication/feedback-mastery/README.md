# Feedback Mastery

A skill for navigating difficult workplace conversations and delivering constructive feedback using proven frameworks.

## Purpose

This skill provides structured approaches to challenging interpersonal situations in the workplace. Whether you need to address performance issues, resolve conflicts between team members, give constructive feedback, or manage stakeholder expectations, this skill offers frameworks backed by research showing that employees who approach difficult conversations with preparation and a clear framework are **60% more likely to reach a positive resolution**.

The skill is designed for software engineering contexts but applies broadly to any professional environment where clear, effective communication is essential.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- **Preparing to give feedback** to a colleague, direct report, or peer
- **Addressing performance issues** such as missed deadlines, quality problems, or engagement concerns
- **Navigating conflict** between yourself and a colleague, or facilitating resolution between team members
- **Having 1:1 conversations** about sensitive topics
- **Receiving feedback** and wanting to respond constructively
- **Managing expectations** with stakeholders, leadership, or clients
- **Resetting expectations** when projects encounter scope creep or timeline pressure

**Trigger phrases:**
- "How do I give feedback about..."
- "I need to have a difficult conversation..."
- "Help me address a performance issue..."
- "How do I handle conflict with..."
- "Prepare me for a 1:1 about..."
- "How do I push back on unrealistic expectations..."
- "Help me with expectation alignment..."

## How It Works

The skill operates through two primary frameworks:

### 1. Preparation-Delivery-Follow-up Model

A three-phase structure for any difficult conversation:

| Phase | Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Preparation** | Understand the issue, define goals, manage emotions | Gather facts, clarify desired outcomes, check emotional readiness |
| **Delivery** | Open neutrally, use facts not blame, encourage dialogue | Present observations objectively, invite their perspective, collaborate on solutions |
| **Follow-up** | Document actions, set check-ins, provide support | Send written summary, schedule follow-up, recognize progress |

### 2. SBI Feedback Model

**Situation-Behavior-Impact** structures feedback to be specific, objective, and actionable:

| Component | What It Is | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Situation** | Specific time and place | "During yesterday's code review..." |
| **Behavior** | Observable action (not interpretation) | "...you provided detailed comments on security vulnerabilities..." |
| **Impact** | Effect on team, project, or person | "...which prevented a costly production bug." |

SBI works because it removes assumptions, focuses on observable facts, and reduces defensiveness.

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Coverage

- **Performance conversations**: Addressing quality issues, missed deadlines, engagement problems
- **Conflict resolution**: Between yourself and others, or facilitating between team members
- **Expectation management**: Setting, communicating, and resetting expectations with stakeholders
- **Receiving feedback**: Guidelines for responding constructively when you're on the receiving end

### Ready-to-Use Scripts

The skill includes opening lines for various scenarios:

```
Performance: "I've noticed some patterns I'd like to discuss. My goal is to support you, not criticize."

Conflict: "I sense there might be some tension, and I'd like to understand what's happening from your side."

Expectations: "I want to make sure we're aligned on expectations. Can we talk through how this project is going?"
```

### Handling Common Reactions

Responses for when conversations get difficult:

- **Defensiveness**: "I want to understand. Can you walk me through what happened from your perspective?"
- **Deflection**: "Right now I want to focus on our conversation. If there are other issues, we can discuss those separately."
- **Emotion**: "I can see this is hitting hard. Would you like to take a few minutes?"
- **Denial**: "I want to make sure we're talking about the same situation. [Describe specifics]. Does that match your recollection?"

### Reframing Techniques

Transform accusatory statements into constructive ones:

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "You always miss deadlines" | "I've noticed some recent delays and want to understand any challenges you're facing" |
| "You never test your code" | "I've seen a few bugs slip through recently. Let's talk about our testing process" |
| "You're not committed" | "I've noticed your updates have been brief in our last three meetings. Is something affecting your workload?" |

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Addressing Code Quality Issues

**Scenario**: A developer has been submitting PRs with increasing bugs and missing tests.

**Using SBI:**
> **Situation**: "In the last three PRs you submitted..."
> **Behavior**: "...there were no unit tests and several changes broke existing tests that weren't updated..."
> **Impact**: "...which caused the CI pipeline to fail repeatedly, blocked other developers' merges, and required the tech lead to spend time debugging."

**Follow-up prompt**: "I want to understand what's making testing difficult. Is there something about our test setup or your workload that's contributing to this?"

### Example 2: Pushing Back on Unrealistic Deadlines

**Scenario**: Leadership wants a feature in half the time your estimates suggest.

**Approach**:
1. Acknowledge the goal: "I understand hitting this date is important for [business reason]."
2. Present data: "Based on similar past work, this typically takes [X]. Here's the breakdown..."
3. Offer options: "We can hit the date by reducing scope to [core features], or deliver full scope by [realistic date]."
4. Get explicit agreement: "Which approach would you like? Can I document this so we're aligned?"

### Example 3: Facilitating Conflict Between Team Members

**Scenario**: Two engineers disagree on a technical approach and it's affecting the team.

**Approach**:
1. Meet separately first: Understand each perspective without the other present
2. Find common ground: "It sounds like you both want [shared goal]. Where you differ is [specific disagreement]."
3. Facilitate together: Focus on facts and trade-offs, not personalities
4. Establish process: "How will the team decide when there's disagreement going forward?"
5. Follow up: Check that the solution is working

### Example 4: Giving Positive Feedback

**Using SBI for recognition:**
> **Situation**: "During Tuesday's code review for the payment processing module..."
> **Behavior**: "...you not only caught the edge case that would have caused data loss, but you also suggested a more elegant solution and included tests demonstrating the issue..."
> **Impact**: "...which prevented a potentially costly bug in production and taught our junior developers about defensive coding."

## Best Practices

### Before the Conversation

- Gather specific, concrete examples (not vague generalizations)
- Define what outcome you're seeking
- Check your emotional state - high emotional intensity reduces cognitive processing by 30%
- Consider their perspective and possible explanations
- Prepare using facts, not interpretations

### During the Conversation

- Open with neutrality and intent, not blame
- Use specific examples rather than "always" or "never"
- Stick to observable behaviors, not assumptions about motives
- Ask for their perspective and genuinely listen
- Collaborate on solutions rather than dictating them
- Document agreed-upon actions before ending

### After the Conversation

- Send a written summary of what was agreed
- Schedule specific check-in dates
- Provide ongoing support to help them succeed
- Recognize and celebrate progress when it happens
- Keep the door open for continued dialogue

### Words to Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "You always..." | "I've noticed a pattern where..." |
| "You never..." | "In recent instances..." |
| "You should have..." | "Going forward, I'd like..." |
| "That's wrong" | "I see it differently" |
| "Obviously..." | "From my perspective..." |
