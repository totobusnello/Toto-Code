# SuperClaude Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts.

## Files

- **clean_command_names.py** - Command name cleaning utility
- **session-init.sh** - Session initialization script

## Important

These scripts are copies from `plugins/superclaude/scripts/` for package distribution.

When updating scripts:
1. Edit files in `plugins/superclaude/scripts/`
2. Copy changes to `src/superclaude/scripts/`
3. Both locations must stay in sync

In v5.0, the plugin system will use `plugins/` directly.
