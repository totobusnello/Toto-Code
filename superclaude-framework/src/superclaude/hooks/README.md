# SuperClaude Hooks

This directory contains hook configuration files.

## Files

- **hooks.json** - Hook definitions for event-driven automation

## Important

These hooks are copies from `plugins/superclaude/hooks/` for package distribution.

When updating hooks:
1. Edit files in `plugins/superclaude/hooks/`
2. Copy changes to `src/superclaude/hooks/`
3. Both locations must stay in sync

In v5.0, the plugin system will use `plugins/` directly.
