## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- The user wants to generate a monthly or quarterly portfolio update presentation
- The user needs to consolidate financial data from multiple company Excel files
- The user asks for a "portfolio report", "portfolio update", or "monthly financials"

## Quick Start

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)

Simply run without arguments:

```

This will interactively ask for:

1. Report type (Monthly or Quarterly)
2. Year and period (month/quarter)
3. Company file locations
4. Output directory
5. Visual generation options

### CLI Mode

Monthly report:

```bash
python portfolio_reporter.py \
  --type monthly \
  --period "December 2025" \
  --directory /path/to/company/files
```

Quarterly report:

```bash
python portfolio_reporter.py \
  --type quarterly \
  --quarter 4 \
  --period "2025" \
  --directory /path/to/company/files
```

With AI visuals (requires GEMINI_API_KEY):

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxx python portfolio_reporter.py --visuals
```

## Output Structure

Reports are organized by period:

```
output/
├── December/                      # Monthly: /{Month}/
│   ├── Consolidated_Summary_Dec_2025.xlsx

## Workflow

### Phase 1: File Collection

Ask the user to provide the financial files. Accept either:

1. **File uploads** - Direct Excel file uploads
2. **Google Drive links** - Links to Excel files on Google Drive
3. **Local file paths** - Paths to Excel files on the local system

Prompt the user:

```
I'll generate your Portfolio Financial Report. Please provide the company financial files in one of these ways:

1. **Upload files** - Drag and drop Excel files here
2. **Google Drive links** - Paste shareable links to Excel files
3. **Local paths** - Provide file paths to Excel files on your system

Which companies should I include? (Default: Mercos, Effecti, Ipê Digital, Datahub, OnClick, Leadlovers)

What reporting period? (e.g., "January-July 2025" or "Jul 2025")
```

### Phase 2: Data Extraction

For each company file, extract data from these sheets:

#### From Monthly Analysis Sheets (`Análise_Resultado_MMYY`)

- Receita Líquida (Net Revenue)
- Deduções (Deductions)
- Lucro Bruto (Gross Profit)
- EBITDA
- Lucro Líquido (Net Profit)
- Depreciation & Amortization

#### From `KPI_Real` Sheet

- Total Clientes (Active Clients)
- % Churn
- MRR
- ARPU

- CAC
- LTV/CAC
- NDR (Net Dollar Retention)
