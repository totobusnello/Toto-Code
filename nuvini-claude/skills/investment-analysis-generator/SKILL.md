## Claude Code Integration

When this skill is invoked in Claude Code:

1. **Identify the triage** - Use Grep/Read to find triage ID or locate saved triage data
2. **Call the API** - Use Bash with curl to POST to the generate endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/triages/{triage_id}/generate-investment-analysis" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```
3. **Present results** - Show download URL and report summary to user

## Examples

### Example 1: Generate from Triage ID
