# Financial Data Extractor

Advanced extraction and analysis for financial data from PDFs (CIMs, financial statements, reports) and Excel files (models, exports, databases). Designed for M&A analysis, due diligence, and financial modeling with **intelligent model selection** for optimal quality-cost balance.

## 🎯 Model Selection Intelligence

This skill includes strategic guidance for choosing between:

**Claude Sonnet 4.5** (Current/Default):
- World's best coding model
- Optimal for 95% of extraction tasks
- Fast, cost-effective, highly accurate
- $3/$15 per million tokens

## Model Selection Guide

### When to Use Sonnet 4.5 (Default) ✅

**Use for 95% of tasks**:
- Initial CIM extraction
- Excel financial model data pulling
- Routine PDF processing
- Batch processing multiple documents
- Automated workflows
- Standard financial analysis
- Deal screening and triage (<$5M deals)

**Example prompt**:
```
"Using Sonnet 4.5, extract all financial metrics from this CIM 
for pipeline screening"
```

### When to Use Opus 4.1 (Premium) ⭐

**Use for critical tasks**:
- Final deal validation (>$25M deals)
- Complex multi-document reconciliation
- Quality of earnings analysis
- Cross-validation of conflicting data
- Investment committee presentations
- Poor quality or ambiguous documents
- Red flag identification

**Example prompt**:
```
"Using Opus 4.1, perform comprehensive validation of these financial 
statements and identify any inconsistencies or red flags"
```

### Decision Framework

| Deal Size | Task | Document Quality | Model |
|-----------|------|-----------------|-------|
| Any | Initial extraction | Clean | Sonnet 4.5 |
| <$5M | All stages | Any | Sonnet 4.5 |
| $5M-$25M | Validation | Clean | Opus 4.1 |
| >$25M | All critical tasks | Any | Opus 4.1 |
| Any | Ambiguous/poor | Poor | Opus 4.1 |

**See references/model_selection_strategy.md for complete decision framework.**

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Two-Stage Extraction (Recommended for Important Deals)

**Stage 1 - Sonnet 4.5**: Fast extraction (30 seconds)
```bash
python scripts/extract_pdf_financials.py cim.pdf --mode all > data.json
```

**Stage 2 - Opus 4.1**: Quality validation (2 minutes)
```
Prompt to Opus 4.1:
"Review this extracted data against the source CIM. Validate accuracy 
of key metrics and flag any inconsistencies."
```

**Result**: Fast extraction + high-confidence validation

### Pattern 2: Quick CIM Analysis (Sonnet 4.5)

For rapid screening:

1. Extract financial figures:
   ```bash
   python scripts/extract_pdf_financials.py cim.pdf --mode figures > figures.json
   ```

2. Review results, extract tables if needed:
   ```bash
   python scripts/extract_pdf_financials.py cim.pdf --mode tables > tables.json
   ```

3. Convert to report:
   ```bash
   python scripts/convert_output.py figures.json --format markdown > report.md
   ```

### Pattern 3: Comprehensive Model Analysis (Sonnet 4.5)

For analyzing complex financial models:

1. Extract all data:
   ```bash
   python scripts/extract_excel_financials.py model.xlsx --mode all > full_data.json
   ```

2. Review structure and identify key sheets

3. Extract specific metrics:
   ```bash
   python scripts/extract_excel_financials.py model.xlsx --mode metrics > metrics.json
   ```

4. Flatten for analysis:
   ```bash
   python scripts/convert_output.py metrics.json --format flat > analysis.json
   ```

### Pattern 4: Multi-Document Due Diligence

**Sonnet 4.5** for bulk extraction:
```bash
for file in *.pdf; do
  python scripts/extract_pdf_financials.py "$file" > "${file%.pdf}.json"
done
```

**Opus 4.1** for validation and reconciliation:
```
Prompt to Opus 4.1:
"Review these extractions from multiple documents and identify 
any inconsistencies in the financial data. Cross-validate key 
metrics across sources."
```

## Best Practices

### Model Selection

1. **Default to Sonnet 4.5** for all standard extraction and automation
2. **Upgrade to Opus 4.1** when:
   - Deal size >$25M
   - Final validation before IC presentation
   - Documents are ambiguous or conflicting
   - Red flags or inconsistencies suspected
   - Complex cross-document analysis required

3. **Cost Rule**: When error cost > model cost difference, use Opus
   - Opus premium: ~$25-50 per analysis
   - Potential error cost: $100K-$1M+
   - For deals >$5M, Opus insurance is trivial

### Data Validation

Always validate extracted data:
- Cross-reference metrics across multiple documents
- Check for unit consistency (thousands vs millions)
- Verify currency (USD, BRL, EUR, etc.)
- Confirm time periods match (fiscal vs calendar year)
- Flag outliers or unexpected values

## Common Use Cases

### M&A Deal Screening (Sonnet 4.5)

Extract key metrics from 50 CIMs to populate deal pipeline:

```bash
# Batch extract from all CIMs
for cim in cims/*.pdf; do
  python scripts/extract_pdf_financials.py "$cim" --mode figures > "extracted/$(basename $cim .pdf).json"
done
```

### Due Diligence Deep Dive (Two-Stage)

Review top 3 targets with Sonnet + Opus:

```bash
# Stage 1: Sonnet extraction
python scripts/extract_pdf_financials.py target_cim.pdf --mode all > data.json
```

Then prompt Opus 4.1:
```
"Review these extractions and validate all key financial metrics, 
consistency, and flag any red flags or inconsistencies."
```

### Investment Committee Prep (Opus 4.1)

Final validation for IC presentation - use Opus 4.1 exclusively for comprehensive validation of all financial data, cross-checking across sources, and identifying any concerns.

## Summary

This skill provides best-in-class financial data extraction with intelligent model selection:

- **Sonnet 4.5**: Fast, accurate, cost-effective for 95% of tasks
- **Opus 4.1**: Premium accuracy for critical 5% where quality is paramount
- **Strategic approach**: Use both models optimally to balance speed, cost, and quality

The key insight: For high-value M&A work, spending $50 on Opus validation is trivial insurance against million-dollar mistakes.
