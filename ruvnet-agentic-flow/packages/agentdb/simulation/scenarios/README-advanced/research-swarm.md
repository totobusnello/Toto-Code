## Technical Details

### Research Workflow
```
1. Literature Review
   ├── Agent 0: Neural architecture search
   ├── Agent 1: Few-shot learning methods
   └── Agent 2: Transfer learning strategies

2. Hypothesis Generation
   └── Synthesize insights from papers
       → "Combining meta-learning with architecture search 
          improves few-shot performance"

3. Experimental Validation
   └── Test hypothesis
       → Result: Confirmed (92% confidence)

4. Knowledge Synthesis
   └── Create reusable research method
       → "meta_architecture_search_protocol"
```

### Causal Links
Papers → Hypotheses (support relationships)
Hypotheses → Experiments (validation links)

## Applications
