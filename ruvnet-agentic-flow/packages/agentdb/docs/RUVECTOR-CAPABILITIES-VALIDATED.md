### ✅ Graph Neural Networks (@ruvector/gnn)

```

## 🔍 Known Non-Issues

### Router Path Validation

**Issue**: @ruvector/router throws "Path traversal attempt detected" error even without storagePath.

**Impact**: Minimal - core routing functionality works, only affects persistence in tests.

**Workaround**: Use maxElements instead of storagePath for in-memory routing.

**Status**: Library issue, not AgentDB integration issue.
