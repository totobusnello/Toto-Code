## 1. Getting Started: Longevity Medicine Practice Setup

### 1.1 Regulatory Considerations

**Scope of Practice by Professional Role:**

| Role | Allowed Activities | Supervision Requirements |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Physician (MD/DO)** | All prescribing, comprehensive assessments, invasive testing | Independent |
| **Nurse Practitioner** | Prescribing per state law, assessments, most interventions | State-dependent (22 states full practice authority) |
| **Physician Assistant** | Prescribing under collaboration, assessments | Physician collaboration agreement required |
| **Health Coach** | Lifestyle counseling, education, monitoring | Cannot prescribe; physician oversight for clinical decisions |

**Off-Label Prescribing Guidelines:**

✓ **Legal**: Metformin for longevity (FDA-approved for diabetes)
✓ **Legal**: Dasatinib+Quercetin investigational (off-label use permitted)
⚠ **Caution**: Rapamycin for longevity (immunosuppression risks)
✓ **Supplements**: NAD+ boosters (NMN, NR) - dietary supplements, no prescription needed

**Required Documentation:**
- Informed consent acknowledging off-label/investigational use
- Discussion of FDA approval status (e.g., "Metformin is FDA-approved for diabetes but not aging")
- Alternative options presented (lifestyle, established therapies)
- Risk-benefit analysis documented
- Patient's decision-making capacity assessed

**State-Specific Considerations:**
- Telemedicine prescribing: Follow state medical board rules
- Compounding pharmacy relationships: Required for specialized formulations
- Lab test ordering: Some states restrict direct-to-consumer ordering

### 1.2 Required Infrastructure

**Biomarker Testing Partnerships:**

**Tier 1 (Essential):**
- Standard clinical lab (LabCorp, Quest): CBC, CMP, lipids, HbA1c, hsCRP, vitamins
- Flow cytometry lab: T-cell p16 mRNA testing (senescent cell burden)

**Tier 2 (Advanced):**
- Epigenetic testing: Horvath/GrimAge DNA methylation clocks (TruDiagnostic, MyDNAge)
- Telomere testing: Flow-FISH preferred over qPCR (RepeatDx, SpectraCell)
- Advanced metabolomics: Metabolon, Boston Heart Diagnostics

**Tier 3 (Research/Optional):**
- Whole genome sequencing: Color, Nebula Genomics
- Proteomics panels: SomaLogic
- Microbiome analysis: Viome, Thorne

**Lab Relationships (Critical for Longevity Practice):**
- **Epigenetic clocks**: TruDiagnostic (physician account required)
- **Senescent cell biomarkers**: Research labs or emerging clinical offerings
- **NAD+ levels**: Jinfiniti Precision Medicine, IntracellularDiagnostics

**Compounding Pharmacy Connections:**
- **NAD+ precursors**: Some physicians prefer pharmaceutical-grade NMN (compounding)
- **Peptides**: BPC-157, thymosin beta-4 (if incorporating peptide therapy)
- **Custom formulations**: Combination supplements

**Supplement Quality Sources:**
- **NAD+ boosters**: Life Extension, ProHealth Longevity, Tru Niagen (NR)
- **Senolytics**: Not commercially available; clinical trial enrollment or investigational protocols
- **Mitochondrial support**: MitoQ (commercial), CoQ10 (ubiquinol form preferred)

### 1.3 Practice Models

**Model 1: Integrated Primary Care + Longevity**
- **Structure**: Existing primary care adds longevity protocols for interested patients
- **Billing**: Mix of insurance (preventive visits) and cash-pay (longevity add-ons)
- **Advantages**: Existing patient base, continuity of care
- **Challenges**: Time constraints, insurance limitations

**Model 2: Standalone Longevity Clinic**
- **Structure**: Concierge/membership-based longevity-focused practice
- **Billing**: 100% cash-pay or high-deductible plans
- **Typical fees**: $3,000-10,000/year membership
- **Advantages**: Comprehensive protocols, extensive time with patients
- **Challenges**: Limited accessibility, requires marketing

**Model 3: Health Coaching + Physician Oversight**
- **Structure**: Health coaches provide 80% of intervention (lifestyle), physician oversees prescribing/labs
- **Billing**: Lower-cost coaching fees + physician consultation fees
- **Advantages**: Scalable, accessible pricing
- **Challenges**: Coordination, scope of practice boundaries

**Model 4: Telemedicine Longevity Practice**
- **Structure**: Virtual consultations, labs ordered to patient's local facility
- **Billing**: Cash-pay, per-consultation or membership
- **Advantages**: Geographic reach, flexibility
- **Challenges**: Physical exam limitations, state licensing

**Revenue Streams:**
- Initial comprehensive assessment: $500-1,500
- Follow-up visits (quarterly): $200-500
- Lab panels: $500-2,000 (markup or patient direct-pay)
- Supplements/peptides: Retail or wholesale pricing
- Group programs: $200-500/person for 12-week cohorts

## 2. Patient Assessment Protocol

### 2.1 Initial Consultation (90-120 Minutes)

**Health History (30 minutes):**

**Comprehensive Review:**
- Current medications (check for drug interactions with longevity interventions)
- Supplement history (many patients self-prescribe; assess quality/dosing)
- Allergies and adverse reactions
- Surgical history (particularly cardiovascular, orthopedic)
- Hospitalizations (assess frailty risk)

**Targeted Longevity-Specific Questions:**
```
❑ Do you have a family history of longevity? (Parents/grandparents age at death)
❑ Family history of age-related diseases? (Heart disease, cancer, dementia, diabetes)
❑ Previous adverse reactions to supplements or off-label medications?
❑ Have you tried any anti-aging interventions? (Caloric restriction, fasting, specific supplements)
❑ Are you currently in clinical trials or research studies?
❑ Reproductive history (women): Number of pregnancies, outcomes
   ▸ Research link: High parity (4+ children) associated with accelerated aging
❑ Smoking history: Current, past, pack-years
❑ Alcohol use: Frequency, quantity (AUDIT-C screening)
❑ Sleep quality: Hours per night, sleep disorders (OSA, insomnia)
❑ Stress assessment: Chronic stressors, coping mechanisms
```

**Family History: Longevity Focus**
- Create 3-generation pedigree
- **Key data points**:
  - Age at death (or current age if living)
  - Cause of death
  - Age at diagnosis of major diseases (CAD, cancer, diabetes, dementia)
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Strong longevity**: Multiple relatives living past 90 without major disease
  - **Moderate longevity**: Average lifespan 75-85
  - **Poor longevity**: Multiple premature deaths (<65)

**Lifestyle Assessment (15 minutes):**

**Diet:**
- Current eating pattern (standard American diet vs. Mediterranean vs. other)
- Caloric intake estimate (use 24-hour recall)
- Macronutrient distribution
- Processed food frequency
- Vegetable/fruit servings per day
- **Tool**: Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) - 14-point questionnaire

**Exercise:**
- Current activity level (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous)
- Aerobic minutes per week
- Resistance training frequency
- Functional limitations (can't walk 1 mile, climb stairs, etc.)
- **Tool**: International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-Short)

**Sleep:**
- Average sleep duration (weekdays vs. weekends)
- Sleep latency (time to fall asleep)
- Awakenings per night
- Snoring/apnea symptoms (STOP-BANG screening)
- Shift work or circadian disruption

**Stress:**
- Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)
- Major life stressors in past year
- Coping strategies (healthy vs. maladaptive)
- Social support assessment

**Goals Alignment (15 minutes):**

**Shared Decision-Making Framework:**

1. **Assess patient's understanding of aging biology**
   - "What do you understand about why we age?"
   - Correct misconceptions (e.g., "aging is inevitable and untreatable")

2. **Explore patient's goals**
   - **Lifespan extension**: "I want to live to 100+"
   - **Healthspan extension**: "I want to stay active and independent as long as possible"
   - **Disease prevention**: "I want to avoid my father's heart attack"
   - **Performance optimization**: "I want more energy and mental clarity"

3. **Set realistic expectations**
   - **Current evidence**: Lifestyle interventions can add 7-10 healthy years (JAMA 2018)
   - **Pharmacological interventions**: Metformin might add 2-3 years (if TAME trial positive)
   - **Senolytics**: Early evidence for frailty reduction, lifespan data pending
   - **NAD+ boosters**: Evidence for biomarker improvement, functional outcomes mixed

4. **Assess commitment level**
   - **High commitment**: Willing to make dietary changes, exercise 5+ days/week, take supplements, monitor biomarkers
   - **Moderate commitment**: Will take medications/supplements, limited lifestyle changes
   - **Low commitment**: "Just prescribe me something"
   - **Match interventions to commitment**: Lifestyle requires high; metformin requires moderate

**Education on Aging Biology (10 minutes):**

**Key Concepts to Convey:**
- **Hallmarks of aging**: 12 processes that accumulate with age (cellular senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, telomere attrition, etc.)
- **Interventions target root causes**: Not just treating symptoms
- **Aging is modifiable**: TAME trial established FDA willingness to consider aging as treatable condition
- **Pyramid approach**: Foundation = lifestyle; pharmaceuticals are additive, not replacement

**Visual Aid Recommendation:** Show aging hallmarks diagram (López-Otín et al. Cell 2023)

### 2.2 Baseline Testing Battery

**Tier 1: Required for All Patients (Standard Labs)**

| Test | Purpose | Normal Range | Interpretation |

## 3. Protocol Implementation

### Month 1: Foundation Building

**Lifestyle Interventions (Non-Negotiable Foundation):**

✓ **Sleep Optimization (Target: 7-9 hours)**
- Sleep hygiene education:
  - Consistent bedtime/wake time (even weekends)
  - Dark, cool bedroom (65-68°F)
  - No screens 1 hour before bed (blue light suppresses melatonin)
  - No caffeine after 2 PM
  - Limit alcohol (disrupts REM sleep)
- **If insomnia persists**: Refer for CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) - superior to medications
- **If OSA suspected (STOP-BANG ≥3)**: Order home sleep study

✓ **Mediterranean Diet Initiation**
- **Core principles** (provide handout):
  - 7-9 servings vegetables/fruits daily
  - Whole grains (not refined)
  - Olive oil primary fat source (4+ Tbsp/day)
  - Nuts daily (1 oz = handful)
  - Fish 2-3x/week (fatty fish: salmon, sardines, mackerel)
  - Legumes 3x/week
  - Limit red meat to 1x/week
  - Limit processed foods, added sugars
  - Moderate red wine (optional, 1 glass/day)
- **Evidence**: 4.5-year RCT showed 30% reduction in major CV events (NEJM 2013)
- **Practical tip**: Meal delivery services (e.g., Mediterranean-focused) for adherence

✓ **Exercise Program Initiation**
- **Baseline assessment**:
  - 6-minute walk test (functional capacity)
  - Grip strength (sarcopenia screening)
  - Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) if frail
- **Prescription** (individualized by fitness level):
  - **Sedentary → Beginner**: Walking 20-30 min, 5 days/week (build to 150 min/week)
  - **Active → Intermediate**: Brisk walking/jogging 30-45 min, 5 days/week PLUS resistance training 2 days/week
  - **Athletic → Advanced**: HIIT 2-3 days/week (4×4 min intervals at 85-95% max HR) PLUS resistance training 3 days/week
- **Referrals**: Physical therapist (if orthopedic limitations), personal trainer (supervision), cardiac rehab (if CAD)

✓ **Stress Management Introduction**
- **Assessment**: Repeat Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)
- **Interventions** (choose 1-2 to start):
  - Mindfulness meditation: 10-20 min/day (Headspace, Calm apps)
  - Yoga: 2-3x/week
  - Therapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) if chronic stress/anxiety
  - Social connection: Schedule time with friends/family weekly
- **Evidence**: Chronic stress accelerates epigenetic aging (PNAS 2012); meditation reverses it (Psychoneuroendocrinology 2018)

**Education on Aging Biology (Provide Written Materials):**
- Handout: "The 12 Hallmarks of Aging and How We Target Them"
- Handout: "Why Lifestyle is the Foundation of Longevity Medicine"
- Recommended reading: *Lifespan* by David Sinclair (popular science), *Outlive* by Peter Attia (clinician perspective)

**Labs Completed This Month:**
- All Tier 1 labs
- Optional Tier 2 labs based on risk stratification

**Supplement Initiation (If Deficiencies Identified):**
- Vitamin D: 2,000-5,000 IU/day (target 50 ng/mL)
- Vitamin B12: 1,000 mcg/day (methylcobalamin sublingual)
- Omega-3: 2-4 g/day EPA+DHA (if not eating fatty fish 2-3x/week)
- Magnesium: 300-400 mg/day (glycinate form) if deficient or low-normal

**Follow-Up:** Schedule 4-week check-in (in-person or telehealth)

---

### Month 2-3: Optimization

**Reassess Lifestyle Adherence (30 min):**
- Review diet logs or 24-hour recalls (assess Mediterranean diet adherence)
- Review exercise logs (assess compliance with prescription)
- Re-administer sleep questionnaire (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index)
- Re-administer stress questionnaire (PSS-10)

**Interventions Adjustments:**

✓ **Time-Restricted Eating (8-10 Hour Window)**
- **Rationale**: Mimics some benefits of caloric restriction without reducing calories
- **Protocol**:
  - Confine all eating to 8-10 hour window (e.g., 10 AM - 6 PM or 12 PM - 8 PM)
  - Start with 10-hour window, narrow to 8 hours if tolerated
  - Maintain on all days (consistency matters)
  - Water, black coffee, unsweetened tea allowed during fasting
- **Evidence**: Improves insulin sensitivity, reduces inflammation (Cell Metabolism 2019)
- **Contraindications**: Underweight (BMI <18.5), eating disorders, pregnancy, insulin-dependent diabetes

✓ **Structured Exercise Progression**
- **Reassess**: Repeat 6-minute walk, grip strength
- **Progression**:
  - Increase intensity (aerobic): Target heart rate zones
    - Moderate: 50-70% max HR
    - Vigorous: 70-85% max HR
    - HIIT: 85-95% max HR (short bursts)
  - Increase resistance training: Progress to 3 sets of 8-12 reps, compound movements (squats, deadlifts, rows, presses)
- **Goal**: Noticeable fitness improvement (e.g., walk farther, lift heavier weights)

**Supplement Foundation (If No Deficiencies, General Longevity Support):**

| Supplement | Dosage | Evidence | Cost/Month |
|------------|--------|----------|------------|
| **Omega-3 (EPA+DHA)** | 2-4 g/day | Level 1a for CV benefit | $20-40 |
| **Vitamin D3** | 2,000-5,000 IU/day | Level 1b for mortality reduction if deficient | $10-15 |
| **Magnesium glycinate** | 300-400 mg/day | Level 2 for sleep, metabolic health | $15-25 |
| **B-complex** | 1 capsule/day (includes methylated B12, folate) | Level 2 for homocysteine lowering, energy | $10-20 |

**Total**: ~$55-100/month for basic stack

**Consider Tier 2 Interventions (Based on Labs/Risk):**

**If Prediabetic (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%):**
- **Initiate metformin** (see Prescribing Guidelines section 4.1)

**If Low NAD+ or High Fatigue:**
- **Consider NAD+ booster trial** (NMN 250-500 mg/day) - see section 4.3

**If High Inflammatory Markers (hsCRP >3 mg/L):**
- **Investigate root causes**: Obesity, sleep apnea, gut dysbiosis, chronic infection
- **Consider anti-inflammatory supplements**: Curcumin 1,000 mg/day, omega-3 high dose (4 g/day)

**Recheck Biomarkers (8-12 Weeks from Baseline):**
- Repeat Tier 1 labs (assess response to lifestyle)
- **Expected changes** if adherent:
  - HbA1c: ↓ 0.3-0.5%
  - hsCRP: ↓ 30-50%
  - Lipids: LDL ↓ 10-20 mg/dL, HDL ↑ 5-10 mg/dL
  - Weight: ↓ 5-10 lbs (if overweight)

**Follow-Up:** Schedule 3-month comprehensive visit

---

### Month 4-6: Advanced Interventions

**Decision Point: Add Pharmacological Interventions?**

**Criteria for Adding Metformin (Even if Not Diabetic):**
- Prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) OR
- Metabolic syndrome (3+ of: waist >40" M / >35" F, TG >150, HDL <40 M / <50 F, BP >130/85, glucose >100) OR
- Strong family history of T2DM OR
- Patient request after informed consent (off-label aging indication)

**If Metformin Initiated:** See section 4.1 for full prescribing protocol

---

**Criteria for Adding NAD+ Boosters:**
- NAD+ levels <50% of young adult reference (if tested) OR
- Age >50 with fatigue despite lifestyle optimization OR
- Mitochondrial dysfunction suspected (low VO2max, muscle weakness) OR
- Patient request after informed consent

**If NAD+ Booster Initiated:** See section 4.3 for protocol

---

**Consider Senolytic Therapy (Clinical Trial Enrollment or Investigational Protocol):**

- High senescent cell burden (p16 T-cell mRNA upper tertile) AND
- Age >60 OR frailty syndrome present OR
- Specific disease indication (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, osteoporosis, diabetic kidney disease) AND
- Willing to participate in monitoring protocol

**Current Status (2025):**
- **Dasatinib + Quercetin**: Only senolytic proven in humans, but NOT FDA-approved for aging
- **Enrollment**: ClinicalTrials.gov search "senolytics" for active trials
- **Off-label use**: Some physicians prescribe investigationally with extensive informed consent

**If Senolytic Considered:** See section 4.4 for protocol and safety monitoring

---

**Epigenetic Age Retest (Optional, for Motivated Patients):**
- Repeat epigenetic clock (GrimAge or PhenoAge)
- **Goal**: Reduce biological age relative to chronological age
- **Typical timeline for changes**: 6-12 months of intervention needed to see epigenetic age shift
- **Cost**: $300-500 per test

---

### Month 7-12: Long-Term Management

**Quarterly Monitoring Schedule:**

| Visit | Focus | Labs |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Month 1** | Initiation, education, baseline labs | Full Tier 1 panel |
| **Month 3** | Adherence check, lifestyle optimization | Tier 1 repeat |
| **Month 6** | Add interventions, assess response | Tier 1 + selective Tier 2 (NAD+, p16 if on senolytics) |
| **Month 9** | Maintenance, troubleshooting | Tier 1 basic (CMP, lipids, HbA1c, hsCRP) |
| **Month 12** | Annual comprehensive reassessment | Full Tier 1 + Tier 2 (epigenetic age, telomeres) |

**Annual Comprehensive Assessment (Month 12):**

✓ **Review goals and adjust**
- Reassess patient priorities (has focus shifted?)
- Celebrate wins (biomarker improvements, functional gains)
- Address challenges (adherence barriers, side effects)

✓ **Functional testing**
- VO2max or 6-minute walk test (assess cardiorespiratory fitness change)
- Grip strength (sarcopenia screening)
- Cognitive screening (MoCA if age >65 or concerns)

✓ **Imaging (age-appropriate)**
- DEXA scan (age >50 women, >60 men, or earlier if risk factors)
- Coronary artery calcium score (consider age >40 with CV risk factors, not if already on statin)

✓ **Protocol refinement**
- Continue what's working
- Discontinue ineffective interventions (if biomarkers not improving)
- Add next-tier interventions if goals not met

## 4. Prescribing Guidelines

### 4.1 Metformin for Longevity

**FDA Status:** Approved for type 2 diabetes; off-label for longevity/prevention

**Indications for Longevity Use:**
1. **Prediabetes** (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%, fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL, or OGTT 140-199 mg/dL)
   - ADA recommends considering metformin, especially if:
     - BMI ≥35
     - Age <60
     - History of gestational diabetes
     - Progressive hyperglycemia despite lifestyle
   - **Evidence Level**: 1a (Diabetes Prevention Program)

2. **Metabolic Syndrome** (3+ criteria: waist circumference >40" M / >35" F, TG >150, HDL <40 M / <50 F, BP >130/85, fasting glucose >100)
   - **Evidence Level**: 1b (secondary prevention of cardiovascular events)

3. **Prevention in High-Risk Non-Diabetics** (off-label, investigational)
   - Strong family history of T2DM
   - PCOS with insulin resistance
   - Cancer prevention (very high-risk individuals, e.g., BRCA carriers)
   - **Evidence Level**: 2-3 (observational data, TAME trial ongoing)

**Dosing Protocol:**

**Starting Dose:**
- **Metformin ER (extended-release)**: 500 mg once daily with dinner
  - ER formulation preferred: 50% fewer GI side effects, once-daily dosing
- Take with largest meal of the day (improves tolerability)

**Titration:**
- Week 1-2: 500 mg/day
- Week 3-4: 1,000 mg/day
- Week 5+: 1,500 mg/day (typical target)
- Maximum: 2,000 mg/day ER (higher doses increase side effects without much added benefit)

**Slower titration** (if GI sensitive): Increase by 500 mg every 2 weeks instead of weekly

**Monitoring:**

| Timepoint | Labs | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Baseline** | eGFR, Cr, CMP, B12, CBC | Screen for contraindications |
| **3 months** | HbA1c (if prediabetic), CMP, B12 | Assess response, check kidney function |
| **6 months** | HbA1c, CMP | Continue monitoring |
| **Annually** | HbA1c, CMP, B12, CBC | Long-term safety surveillance |

**Contraindications (Absolute):**
- eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m² (severe renal impairment)
- Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis (including diabetic ketoacidosis)
- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C cirrhosis)
- Acute illness: Sepsis, MI, stroke, respiratory failure (hold metformin)
- Alcohol abuse (increases lactic acidosis risk)

**Contraindications (Relative, Use Caution):**
- eGFR 30-45 mL/min/1.73m² (reduce dose to 500-1,000 mg/day, do not initiate if <45)
- Heart failure requiring pharmacological treatment (old black box warning removed, but caution)
- Age >80 (higher risk of lactic acidosis, renal decline)

**Special Situations:**

**Iodinated Contrast (CT with IV contrast, cardiac catheterization):**
- **Hold metformin** 48 hours before procedure
- Check eGFR before restarting
- Resume if eGFR stable and ≥30

**Surgery:**
- **Hold metformin** day of surgery (NPO status)
- Resume when eating normally and hemodynamically stable

**Expected Outcomes (for Longevity, Not Diabetes Treatment):**

**Metabolic:**
- ↓ HbA1c: 0.5-1.0% (if prediabetic)
- ↓ Fasting insulin: 10-20%
- ↓ Weight: 2-3 kg average (weight neutral compared to other diabetes drugs)

**Inflammation:**
- ↓ hsCRP: 20-30%
- Possible ↓ IL-6, TNF-α

**Long-Term (Observational Data, Not Proven in RCTs for Non-Diabetics):**
- ↓ Cancer incidence: 31% (meta-analysis in diabetics)
- ↓ Cardiovascular events: 30-40% (diabetic populations)
- Longevity: TAME trial results pending (2027-2028)

**Side Effects:**

**Common (20-30% incidence):**
- Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramping, metallic taste
  - **Management**: Slow titration, take with food, switch to ER formulation, anti-diarrheal (loperamide) PRN
  - Most GI effects resolve after 2-4 weeks
- Vitamin B12 deficiency: 10-30% long-term users (mechanism: impaired ileal absorption)
  - **Prevention**: Supplement B12 1,000-2,000 mcg/day (high dose overcomes absorption defect)
  - **Monitor**: Check B12 annually; if <400 pg/mL, increase supplementation or give IM B12

**Rare but Serious (<0.01% incidence):**
- Lactic acidosis (high mortality 30-50% if occurs)
  - **Risk factors**: Renal impairment, liver disease, alcohol abuse, acute illness
  - **Symptoms**: Hyperventilation, abdominal pain, altered mental status, hypotension
  - **Prevention**: Screen for contraindications, patient education (hold during illness), monitor renal function

**Discontinuation Rate:** 5-10% due to GI intolerance (lower with ER formulation)

**Patient Education Points:**
1. "Metformin is FDA-approved for diabetes but not aging; we are using it off-label based on strong evidence it may reduce age-related disease risk."
2. "Common side effects are GI (diarrhea, nausea) in first few weeks; these usually improve. Take with food."
3. "You must take vitamin B12 daily because metformin blocks absorption long-term."
4. "Hold metformin if you get very sick (vomiting, dehydration, hospital admission) and call us."
5. "We will check your kidney function regularly because metformin is cleared by kidneys."

**Informed Consent Documentation:**
```
☐ Discussed off-label use for longevity/disease prevention
☐ Reviewed evidence: DPP trial (prediabetes), observational data (cancer/CV), TAME trial ongoing
☐ Reviewed common side effects (GI, B12 deficiency) and management
☐ Reviewed rare risk of lactic acidosis and contraindications
☐ Discussed alternative approaches (lifestyle alone, other medications)
☐ Patient expressed understanding and provided verbal consent
```

### 4.2 Rapamycin (Investigational/Clinical Trial Only)

**FDA Status:** Approved for transplant rejection, certain cancers; NOT approved for aging

**Clinical Use for Longevity:** **ONLY in research protocols with IRB approval**

**Why Rapamycin is Not Standard of Care:**
- Immunosuppression risk (increased infection susceptibility)
- Metabolic side effects (hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia)
- No human RCT data for longevity (only mouse data: 10-15% lifespan extension)
- Ethical and regulatory barriers

**If Prescribed (Research/Self-Experimenting Physicians):**

**Pulse Dosing Protocol (Theoretical, Based on Animal Studies):**
- **Dose**: 5-8 mg once weekly (vs. 1-5 mg daily for transplant)
  - Rationale: Intermittent dosing may reduce side effects while maintaining mTOR inhibition benefits
- **Monitoring**: CBC, CMP, lipids monthly initially, then quarterly
- **Duration**: Ongoing (no defined stopping point)

**Expected Mechanism:**
- mTOR inhibition → ↑ autophagy → clearance of damaged proteins/organelles
- ↓ Protein synthesis → ↓ cellular stress
- ↑ Mitochondrial function

**Known Side Effects (from Transplant Literature):**
- Immunosuppression: Increased infection risk, delayed wound healing
- Metabolic: Hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance (paradoxical)
- Mouth ulcers (stomatitis): Common
- Proteinuria (kidney)
- Interstitial pneumonitis (rare but serious)

**Clinical Trials:**
- **Search**: ClinicalTrials.gov for "rapamycin aging" or "sirolimus longevity"
- **Enrolling studies**: Typically small pilot studies at academic centers

**Recommendation:** Await human RCT data before widespread use. If interested, seek clinical trial enrollment.

### 4.3 NAD+ Boosters (NMN / NR)

**FDA Status:** Dietary supplements (not FDA-regulated as drugs)

**Indications:**
1. **Age >50** with declining NAD+ levels (if tested) or symptoms suggestive:
   - Chronic fatigue despite adequate sleep/nutrition
   - Reduced exercise capacity
   - Cognitive decline
2. **Mitochondrial dysfunction** suspected (low VO2max, muscle weakness)
3. **Adjunct to metformin/exercise** to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis
4. **High-parity women** (postpartum mitochondrial recovery - investigational)

**NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide):**

**Dosing:**
- **Starting dose**: 250 mg/day (morning, empty stomach for best absorption)
- **Target dose**: 500-1,000 mg/day
- **Timing**: Single morning dose or split AM/noon (avoid evening - may interfere with sleep due to increased energy)

**Expected Effects:**
- **NAD+ increase**: 6-fold increase in whole blood (clinical trial data, 250 mg/day)
- **Functional outcomes**: Mixed evidence
  - ✓ Some patients: Improved energy, exercise capacity, cognitive clarity
  - ✗ RCT data: No significant improvement in insulin sensitivity, physical function (6-week trial)
  - Interpretation: Responder variability, may need longer duration (>12 weeks)

**Product Quality:**
- **Pharmaceutical-grade**: ProHealth Longevity, Alive by Science, Renue by Science
- **Third-party tested**: Look for certificate of analysis (COA) for purity
- **Avoid**: Amazon supplements without COA (contamination risk)

**Cost**: $50-150/month (depending on dose and brand)

---

**NR (Nicotinamide Riboside):**

**Dosing:**
- **Starting dose**: 250-500 mg/day
- **Target dose**: 1,000 mg/day
- **Timing**: Morning or split AM/PM

**Expected Effects:**
- **NAD+ increase**: 2.5-fold (smaller than NMN but still significant)
- **Functional outcomes**:
  - Mild cognitive improvement in MCI (small study)
  - Improved vascular function in PAD patients
  - Mixed data on exercise performance

**Product Quality:**
- **Patented/studied form**: Tru Niagen (Chromadex) - used in clinical trials
- **Generic NR**: Life Extension, ProHealth Longevity

**Cost**: $50-100/month

---

**NMN vs. NR Comparison:**

| Feature | NMN | NR |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **NAD+ increase** | 6-fold | 2.5-fold |
| **Mechanism** | Direct precursor (NMNAT conversion) | Requires NRK1/2 conversion to NMN first |
| **Speed** | Faster | Slower |
| **Evidence** | Fewer human trials | More established (Tru Niagen trials) |
| **Cost** | Similar | Similar |
| **Recommendation** | Slight edge for efficacy | Slight edge for safety data |

**Clinical Recommendation:** Either is reasonable; some clinicians prefer NMN for higher NAD+ boost, others prefer NR for more clinical trial data. Trial both if one doesn't produce subjective benefit.

---

**Monitoring:**

| Timepoint | Assessment | Labs (Optional) |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Baseline** | Energy level (1-10 scale), VO2max or 6MWT | NAD+ levels (if available) |
| **4-8 weeks** | Reassess energy, exercise capacity | None required |
| **3-6 months** | Functional improvements? If yes, continue; if no, consider discontinuation | Repeat NAD+ (if initial test done) |

**Expected Timeline:**
- **Energy/cognition**: 2-4 weeks (subjective, some patients notice immediately, others never)
- **Physical performance**: 8-12 weeks (if detectable)
- **Biomarkers**: 8-12 weeks (NAD+ levels, mitochondrial function tests)

**Side Effects:**
- **Minimal**: NAD+ boosters very well-tolerated
- Possible: Flushing (niacin-like, rare), GI upset (mild), insomnia if taken late in day

**Contraindications:**
- **Cancer patients**: Theoretical concern that NAD+ may fuel tumor metabolism (discuss with oncologist)
- **Pregnancy/lactation**: Insufficient safety data (avoid)

**Adjunct Strategies to Enhance NAD+ (Beyond Supplements):**
- **Exercise**: Increases NAD+ via AMPK activation
- **Caloric restriction / Time-restricted eating**: ↑ NAD+/NADH ratio
- **Avoid NAD+ depletion**: Minimize chronic inflammation (lowers CD38 activity, NAD+ consumer)
- **B-vitamins**: Niacin, B12, folate (NAD+ precursors/cofactors)

**Patient Education:**
- "NAD+ is a molecule that declines 50% by age 50; it powers your mitochondria and activates anti-aging enzymes called sirtuins."
- "Supplements can restore NAD+ levels, but evidence for functional improvement is still emerging. Some people notice more energy, others don't."
- "We'll try for 3 months and see if you notice benefits. If not, we can discontinue."

### 4.4 Senolytic Therapy (Dasatinib + Quercetin)

**FDA Status:** Dasatinib FDA-approved for CML; Quercetin is supplement; **Combination NOT FDA-approved for aging**

**Current Clinical Status (2025):**
- **Proven in humans**: First-in-human trials showed reduction in senescent cells
- **FDA approval**: NONE for aging indication
- **Clinical trial enrollment**: Multiple ongoing trials (IPF, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's, frailty)
- **Off-label prescribing**: Some physicians prescribe investigationally with extensive informed consent and monitoring

**Indications (Investigational):**
1. **High senescent cell burden**: p16 T-cell mRNA upper tertile (requires specialized lab testing)
2. **Age-related diseases where senolytics studied**:
   - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
   - Osteoporosis (postmenopausal women)
   - Diabetic kidney disease
   - Alzheimer's disease / mild cognitive impairment
   - Frailty syndrome (gait speed <1.0 m/s, SPPB <10)
3. **Age >60** with multiple comorbidities (not responding to standard care)

**Patient Selection (Critical for Efficacy):**
- **Best responders**: High baseline senescent cell burden
  - Evidence: Osteoporosis RCT (2024) - benefits ONLY in highest tertile p16 expression
- **Poor responders**: Low senescent cell burden (no benefit, waste of resources/risk)
- **Implication**: **Must measure p16 T-cell mRNA** before initiating (send to research lab or emerging clinical labs)

**Dosing Protocol ("Hit-and-Run" Intermittent):**

**Standard Protocol:**
- **Dasatinib**: 100 mg PO
- **Quercetin**: 1,000-1,250 mg PO (split 500 mg BID or 1,250 mg once)
- **Frequency**: 2 consecutive days every 2 weeks for 6 cycles (12 weeks total)
  - Example: Days 1-2, Days 15-16, Days 29-30, Days 43-44, Days 57-58, Days 71-72
- **Route**: Oral, with food (improves absorption and reduces GI upset)

**Alternative Protocol (from IPF trial):**
- 3 consecutive days per week for 3 weeks (total 9 dosing days)

**Rationale for Intermittent Dosing:**
- Dasatinib half-life: 4 hours; Quercetin half-life: 11 hours
- Senescent cells persist (unlike normal cells that recover quickly)
- "Hit-and-run" minimizes side effects while maintaining efficacy

**Monitoring:**

| Timepoint | Labs | Clinical Assessment |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| **Baseline** | CBC (especially platelets), CMP, p16 T-cell mRNA, SASP factors (IL-6, IL-8, GDF15) | 6MWT, grip strength, SPPB, frailty assessment |
| **Week 2** | CBC (check platelets - dasatinib can cause thrombocytopenia) | Adverse events |
| **Week 4** | CBC, p16, SASP factors | 6MWT, grip strength |
| **Week 12** | CBC, CMP, p16, SASP factors | 6MWT, grip strength, SPPB, functional improvement assessment |
| **Week 20** | p16, SASP factors | Final outcome assessment |

**Expected Outcomes (Based on Clinical Trials):**

**Biomarkers:**
- ↓ p16+ cells (adipose tissue, T-cells): 30-50% reduction
- ↓ SA-β-gal+ cells (tissue biopsy)
- ↓ SASP factors: IL-6, IL-8, MMP-9, MMP-12 reduced
- ↑ Urinary alpha-klotho (anti-aging marker)
- ↓ GPNMB (emerging response biomarker)

**Functional Outcomes (Variable):**
- 6-minute walk distance: Improved in IPF patients (>5% increase)
- Gait speed: Improved in some frailty studies
- Physical function: SPPB score improvement
- Bone density: Increased in high senescent burden osteoporosis patients (radius BMD)
- **NOT improved**: Pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1) in IPF, cognitive function in AD (short trials)

**Interpretation:** Benefits most evident in physical function and biomarkers; disease-specific outcomes mixed.

**Side Effects (from Clinical Trials):**

**Common (Mild-Moderate, 40-60% incidence):**
- Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramping
  - **Management**: Anti-diarrheal (loperamide PRN), anti-nausea (ondansetron PRN)
- Skin: Irritation, bruising (dasatinib is antiplatelet)
- Respiratory symptoms: Cough, dyspnea (in IPF patients, may be disease-related)
- Fatigue (transient, days 1-3 of cycle)

**Serious (Rare, <5% in trials):**
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Dasatinib inhibits BCL-xL in platelets (monitor CBC)
  - **Management**: Hold dosing if platelets <100,000; resume when >150,000
- Bleeding risk (minor): Epistaxis, ecchymosis (dasatinib antiplatelet effect)
- Pulmonary edema (rare, dasatinib FDA black box warning for chronic use in CML)
  - Mitigation: Intermittent dosing reduces risk significantly vs. continuous

**No early discontinuations** in IPF, DKD, or osteoporosis trials (tolerability acceptable)

**Contraindications:**
- **Absolute**:
  - Active bleeding or bleeding disorder
  - Thrombocytopenia (baseline platelets <100,000)
  - Severe hepatic impairment
  - Pregnancy/lactation
  - Concurrent anticoagulation (warfarin, DOACs) - relative, use caution
- **Relative**:
  - History of pulmonary edema or pleural effusion
  - Recent surgery (<2 weeks)
  - Concurrent antiplatelet beyond aspirin (clopidogrel, etc.)

**Drug Interactions:**
- **CYP3A4 interactions**: Dasatinib metabolized by CYP3A4
  - **Avoid**: Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, ritonavir) - increase dasatinib levels
  - **Avoid**: Strong CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin, phenytoin) - decrease dasatinib levels
- **H2 blockers / PPIs**: May reduce dasatinib absorption (take 2 hours before or after)
- **Anticoagulants/antiplatelets**: Increased bleeding risk

**Informed Consent (Extensive, Given Investigational Nature):**
```
☐ Explained: Dasatinib + Quercetin NOT FDA-approved for aging/senescence
☐ Reviewed: Clinical trial evidence (first-in-human, IPF, DKD, osteoporosis trials)
☐ Emphasized: Benefits only seen in HIGH senescent cell burden patients (p16 testing required)
☐ Discussed: Expected outcomes (biomarker reduction, possible functional improvement)
☐ Reviewed: Common side effects (GI, skin, fatigue) and management
☐ Reviewed: Rare serious risks (thrombocytopenia, bleeding, pulmonary edema)
☐ Discussed: Monitoring plan (CBC every 2 weeks initially, then monthly)
☐ Offered alternatives: Clinical trial enrollment, lifestyle optimization, wait for more data
☐ Documented: Patient expressed understanding, voluntarily chose to proceed
☐ Provided: Written information sheet on senolytics
```

**When to Discontinue:**
- Serious adverse event (thrombocytopenia <50,000, bleeding, pulmonary edema)
- No biomarker improvement after 12 weeks (re-check p16, SASP factors)
- Patient request (side effects intolerable)

**Future Directions:**
- **Phase 3 RCTs**: Needed for FDA approval
- **Next-generation senolytics**: Fisetin (ongoing trials), navitoclax (thrombocytopenia mitigation needed), FOXO4-DRI peptide (preclinical)
- **Immunotherapy**: CAR-T cells targeting senescent cells (early research)

**Clinical Bottom Line:**
- Senolytics show promise but remain **investigational**
- **Recommend clinical trial enrollment** over off-label prescribing when possible
- If prescribing off-label:
  - Require p16 testing (don't treat blindly)
  - Extensive informed consent
  - Close monitoring (CBC, biomarkers)
  - Document thoroughly (off-label use, IRB exemption if applicable)

---

**Age 60+ (Maintenance/Reversal Phase)**

| Biomarker | Target | Intervention if Abnormal |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| **HbA1c** | <6.0% (if diabetic: <7.0%, avoid over-treatment) | Balance glycemic control with hypoglycemia risk |

---

### 5.2 When to Adjust Protocol

**Scenario 1: Biomarkers Not Improving After 3 Months**

**Assessment:**
- Re-evaluate adherence: Diet logs, exercise logs, supplement compliance
- Check for confounders: New medications, stress, sleep deprivation, illness

**Adjustments:**
- **If non-adherent**: Simplify protocol, address barriers (cost, time, motivation)
- **If adherent but no change**:
  - Lifestyle: Increase intensity (exercise), stricter diet (eliminate processed foods)
  - Supplements: Add next tier (NAD+ boosters if not on, mitochondrial support)
  - Medications: Add metformin (if not on), consider senolytics (if high p16)

---

**Scenario 2: Patient Non-Adherence (Common)**

**Identify Barriers:**
- **Cost**: Supplements/tests expensive → prioritize, offer lower-cost alternatives
- **Time**: Exercise/meal prep challenging → simplify (meal delivery, shorter workouts)
- **Motivation**: Goals unclear or unrealistic → re-align goals, celebrate small wins
- **Side effects**: GI from metformin, fatigue from exercise → adjust dosing, intensity

**Simplification Strategy:**
- **Minimum effective protocol**: Mediterranean diet + walking 30 min/day + metformin (if indicated) + vitamin D/B12
- Eliminate optional interventions until adherence improves

---

**Scenario 3: Adverse Effects**

**Metformin GI Intolerance:**
- Slow titration (500 mg every 2 weeks)
- Switch to ER formulation
- Take with largest meal
- Anti-diarrheal PRN
- If persistent: Discontinue, try NAD+ boosters or lifestyle alone

**NAD+ Booster Insomnia:**
- Move dose to morning only
- Reduce dose
- If persistent: Discontinue

**Senolytic Thrombocytopenia:**
- Hold next cycle
- Recheck CBC weekly
- Resume when platelets >150,000
- If recurrent: Discontinue permanently

---

**Scenario 4: Patient Goals Change**

**Example:** Patient initially focused on lifespan extension, now prioritizes quality of life (e.g., after cancer diagnosis)

**Adjustment:**
- Shift from aggressive interventions (senolytics, multiple supplements) to symptom management and functional optimization
- Maintain lifestyle interventions (proven quality of life benefits)
- Discontinue investigational therapies with uncertain benefit

---

**Scenario 5: New Evidence Emerges**

**Example:** TAME trial results published (hypothetical 2027), shows metformin does NOT extend healthspan in non-diabetics

**Adjustment:**
- Re-counsel all patients on metformin for aging indication
- Offer discontinuation (continue only if diabetic/prediabetic)
- Redirect to interventions with stronger evidence

**Staying Current:** Subscribe to journals (*Nature Aging*, *Aging Cell*, *GeroScience*), follow @TurningPoint2023 (longevity research Twitter), attend conferences (American Aging Association)

## 6. Common Clinical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: 45-Year-Old Man with Metabolic Syndrome

**Presentation:**
- Age: 45
- Chief complaint: "I want to avoid my father's heart attack at age 55"
- PMH: Hypertension (controlled on lisinopril 10 mg), prediabetes (HbA1c 6.1%)
- Family history: Father MI at 55 (died), mother T2DM
- Social: Sedentary office job, fast food 4x/week, no regular exercise, sleeps 6 hours/night
- Vitals: BP 138/88, BMI 32 (obese)
- Labs: HbA1c 6.1%, hsCRP 3.8 mg/L, LDL 145 mg/dL, HDL 35 mg/dL, TG 220 mg/dL
- Risk: Metabolic syndrome (5/5 criteria), high CV risk

---

**Step-by-Step Protocol:**

**Month 1: Foundation + Urgent Risk Reduction**

✓ **Lifestyle (High Priority):**
- **Diet**: Mediterranean diet, eliminate fast food (replace with meal delivery service or batch cooking on weekends)
- **Exercise**: Start walking 30 min/day (lunch break or after work), goal 150 min/week
- **Sleep**: Target 7 hours (sleep hygiene education, consider CBT-I if insomnia)
- **Stress**: Mindfulness app (Headspace) 10 min/day

✓ **Medications:**
- **Continue** lisinopril 10 mg (BP control)
- **ADD metformin ER** 500 mg nightly (titrate to 1,500 mg over 4 weeks)
  - Indication: Prediabetes + metabolic syndrome (strong evidence, ADA-recommended)
- **ADD atorvastatin** 20 mg nightly (LDL >130 + high CV risk)
  - Target LDL <100, ideally <70 given family history
- **Supplement**: Vitamin D 4,000 IU/day, omega-3 2 g/day, B12 1,000 mcg/day

✓ **Monitoring:** Recheck labs in 12 weeks (HbA1c, lipids, hsCRP, CMP)

---

**Month 3: Reassess and Optimize**

**Labs:**
- HbA1c: 5.8% (improved from 6.1%, still prediabetic)
- hsCRP: 2.1 mg/L (improved from 3.8, but still elevated)
- LDL: 95 mg/dL (at goal)
- Weight: Lost 12 lbs (BMI now 30)

**Assessment:** Partial response, on right track

**Adjustments:**
- **Metformin**: Increase to 2,000 mg ER daily (maximize benefit)
- **Exercise**: Add 2 days/week resistance training (gym or home weights)
- **Diet**: Continue, consider time-restricted eating (8-hour window) to further improve insulin sensitivity
- **ADD**: NAD+ booster (NMN 500 mg/day) if energy still low despite weight loss

---

**Month 6: Continued Improvement**

**Labs:**
- HbA1c: 5.6% (no longer prediabetic)
- hsCRP: 1.2 mg/L (improved, near goal)
- Weight: Lost 20 lbs total (BMI 29)
- VO2max (tested): 28 mL/kg/min (improved from estimated <25 baseline)

**Assessment:** Excellent response, maintain course

**Long-Term Plan:**
- **Continue** metformin indefinitely (evidence for CV protection, cancer prevention)
- **Continue** statin (LDL maintenance)
- **Lifestyle maintenance**: Quarterly check-ins to sustain adherence
- **Monitor**: Annual labs (HbA1c, lipids, hsCRP, CMP, B12)

**Outcome:** Reduced 10-year CV risk from 15% to 7% (Framingham Risk Score); likely added 5-7 healthy years

---

### Scenario 2: 60-Year-Old Woman with Family History of Alzheimer's

**Presentation:**
- Age: 60
- Chief complaint: "My mother and aunt both had Alzheimer's. I'm terrified. What can I do?"
- PMH: Healthy, no chronic diseases
- Family history: Mother diagnosed AD at 68 (died at 75), maternal aunt AD at 72
- Cognitive: MoCA score 27/30 (mild subjective cognitive decline, no MCI)
- ApoE genotype: E3/E4 heterozygote (2-3x increased AD risk)
- Vitals: BP 125/78, BMI 24 (normal)
- Labs: All normal (HbA1c 5.3%, hsCRP 0.8 mg/L, lipids optimal)
- Baseline testing: VO2max 32 mL/kg/min (average for age), epigenetic age = chronological age

---

**Step-by-Step Protocol:**

**Month 1: Neuroprotection Focus**

✓ **Lifestyle (Brain-Specific):**
- **Diet**: MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay)
  - Emphasize: Leafy greens (6+ servings/week), berries (2+ servings/week), nuts, olive oil, fish
  - Limit: Red meat, butter, cheese, fried foods
  - Evidence: 53% reduced AD risk (Rush University study)
- **Exercise**: Aerobic exercise 150 min/week (improves brain blood flow, neurogenesis)
  - Add: 2 days/week resistance training (prevents sarcopenia, insulin resistance)
- **Cognitive training**: Dual n-back training (Lumosity, BrainHQ) 20 min, 3x/week
  - Evidence: Mixed, but low-risk adjunct
- **Sleep**: Optimize to 7-8 hours (sleep deprivation impairs amyloid clearance)
- **Social engagement**: Maintain active social life (protective against cognitive decline)

✓ **Supplements (Neuroprotective Stack):**
- **Omega-3 (DHA-rich)**: 2 g/day (DHA crosses blood-brain barrier, anti-inflammatory)
- **B-vitamin complex**: Methylated B12, B6, folate (lowers homocysteine, slows brain atrophy in MCI)
- **Vitamin D**: 2,000 IU/day (maintain >40 ng/mL)
- **Curcumin**: 1,000 mg/day (anti-inflammatory, may reduce amyloid plaques)
- **Resveratrol**: 150 mg/day (SIRT1 activation, may improve brain blood flow)

✓ **Optional: Consider Clinical Trial Enrollment**
- **Senolytic trials for AD**: SToMP-AD style trials (Dasatinib+Quercetin)
- **Anti-amyloid therapies**: Lecanemab, donanemab (if MCI progresses)

✓ **Monitoring:**
- Cognitive: MoCA annually
- Biomarkers: p-tau, Aβ42/40 ratio (CSF or blood-based - emerging tests)
- Imaging: Brain MRI at baseline (rule out vascular disease, atrophy), repeat if symptoms progress

**Month 6: Reassess**

**Assessment:**
- MoCA: Stable 27/30
- Subjective: "I feel sharper, less forgetful"
- VO2max: 35 mL/kg/min (improved)
- Labs: All stable

**Adjustments:**
- **Continue** current protocol
- **ADD consideration**: NAD+ booster (NR 1,000 mg/day)
  - Rationale: NAD+ declines in aging brain, sirtuins protect neurons
  - Evidence: Small pilot studies suggest cognitive improvement in MCI
- **Monitor for trial enrollment**: Check ClinicalTrials.gov quarterly for AD prevention trials

---

**Long-Term (5-10 Years):**

**If MCI develops (MoCA <26, functional decline):**
- **Aggressive intervention**:
  - Enroll in anti-amyloid trial (lecanemab, donanemab)
  - Add metformin (epidemiological data suggests reduced dementia risk)
  - Consider senolytics (if trials show efficacy in AD)
- **Specialist referral**: Neurologist, geriatric psychiatrist

**Outcome:** Goal is to delay AD onset from 68 (mother's age) to 75+ (7+ year delay = significant quality of life improvement)

---

### Scenario 3: 35-Year-Old Biohacker Optimizing Healthspan

**Presentation:**
- Age: 35
- Chief complaint: "I'm healthy now, but I want to live to 120. What's the most cutting-edge stuff?"
- PMH: None
- Vitals: BP 110/70, BMI 22, resting HR 52 (athletic)
- Current regimen: Paleo diet, CrossFit 5x/week, intermittent fasting (16:8), takes 15+ supplements (multi, vitamin D, omega-3, magnesium, ashwagandha, collagen, etc.)
- Labs: All optimal (HbA1c 4.9%, hsCRP 0.3 mg/L, lipids perfect, vitamin D 65 ng/mL)
- Advanced testing: Epigenetic age 32 (3 years younger than chronological), VO2max 48 mL/kg/min (elite)
- Goal: "I want to be on the bleeding edge of longevity interventions"

---

**Step-by-Step Protocol:**

**Assessment: Already Optimal, Diminishing Returns Territory**

**Discussion Points:**
- "You're already in the top 1% for healthspan. Additional interventions have uncertain benefit."
- "The evidence for interventions beyond what you're doing is weak (small effect sizes, often only preclinical data)."
- "Risk-benefit shifts: adding more has potential downsides (cost, side effects, time) with unclear upside."

---

**Conservative Additions (if patient insists):**

✓ **Refined Current Regimen:**
- **Supplement audit**: Review current 15 supplements, eliminate redundancies
  - Keep: Multi (basic insurance), vitamin D (optimal levels), omega-3 (anti-inflammatory), magnesium (if deficient)
  - Consider dropping: Ashwagandha (unclear benefit in healthy young adults), collagen (no strong evidence for longevity), others without clear rationale

✓ **Add NAD+ Booster (Experimental)**
- NMN 500 mg/day OR NR 1,000 mg/day
- Rationale: At age 35, NAD+ starting to decline; may support mitochondrial function during intense training
- Evidence: Weak at this age (trials mostly in 50+ populations), but low-risk
- **Caveat**: May not notice subjective benefit (already high energy/performance)

✓ **Add Spermidine (Autophagy Inducer)**
- 1-10 mg/day (from wheat germ extract or supplement)
- Rationale: Induces autophagy (cellular housekeeping), associated with longevity in observational studies
- Evidence: Preclinical strong, human data limited to observational (high dietary spermidine correlates with longevity)

✓ **Advanced Testing (Annually):**
- **Epigenetic clocks**: GrimAge, PhenoAge (monitor if biological age stays <chronological)
- **Telomere length**: Flow-FISH (baseline reference, monitor stability)
- **Metabolomics panel**: Comprehensive metabolic health snapshot
- **Goal**: Early detection of any drift toward accelerated aging

---

**What NOT to Add (Overly Aggressive, Insufficient Evidence):**

❌ **Metformin**: No indication (not prediabetic, already optimal metabolically)
- Potential harm: May blunt exercise adaptations (Konopka study)
- Recommendation: Wait until prediabetic or age 50+

❌ **Rapamycin**: No indication, immunosuppression risk unacceptable in healthy 35-year-old
- Recommendation: Wait for human RCT data

❌ **Senolytics**: No indication (senescent cell burden negligible at age 35)
- Recommendation: Reassess at age 60+

❌ **Peptides (BPC-157, Thymosin)**: No FDA approval, injection burden, limited human safety data
- Recommendation: Avoid unless injury/specific medical need

---

**Reassess Annually:**
- Repeat labs, epigenetic age, VO2max
- If all stable/optimal, continue current protocol
- Add interventions only if evidence base strengthens or biomarkers decline

**Counseling:**
- "Your lifestyle (diet, exercise, stress management) is 80% of the longevity equation. Supplements/drugs are 10-20% at most."
- "Focus on sustainability: can you maintain this regimen for 50 years? If not, simplify."
- "Consider non-interventional investments: strong relationships, fulfilling work, financial security (these affect healthspan too)."

**Outcome:** Already maximized healthspan potential with current regimen; additional interventions marginal benefit, emphasize maintenance.

---

### Scenario 4: 70-Year-Old with Frailty

**Presentation:**
- Age: 70
- Chief complaint: "I'm slowing down. I can barely walk to the mailbox anymore."
- PMH: T2DM (HbA1c 7.2% on metformin 1,000 mg BID), hypertension (on amlodipine 10 mg), osteoarthritis (knees, on tramadol PRN)
- Functional: Gait speed 0.7 m/s (frailty threshold <0.8), SPPB score 7/12 (frail), grip strength 22 kg (low for age)
- Falls: 2 falls in past year (major concern)
- Vitals: BP 145/85, BMI 27
- Labs: HbA1c 7.2%, hsCRP 4.5 mg/L (high inflammation), vitamin D 22 ng/mL (deficient), B12 350 pg/mL (low-normal)
- Sarcopenia: DEXA shows appendicular lean mass index 6.2 kg/m² (sarcopenic)

**Diagnosis: Frailty syndrome (physical frailty)**

---

**Step-by-Step Protocol:**

**Month 1: Safety + Foundation**

✓ **Immediate Safety (Fall Prevention):**
- Home safety assessment (PT home visit): Remove tripping hazards, install grab bars, improve lighting
- Assistive device: Consider cane or walker for outdoor ambulation
- Medication review: Tramadol may increase fall risk (sedation), consider topical NSAIDs instead
- Vitamin D repletion: 50,000 IU weekly × 8 weeks (correct deficiency → improve muscle strength, reduce fall risk)

✓ **Metabolic Optimization:**
- **Diabetes**: Continue metformin, optimize HbA1c to 7.0-7.5% (avoid over-treatment → hypoglycemia → falls)
- **Inflammation**: High hsCRP (4.5 mg/L) driving frailty
  - Investigate: Infection? Chronic disease flare? Obesity?
  - Treat: Anti-inflammatory diet (Mediterranean), omega-3 4 g/day, consider low-dose aspirin (if no contraindications)
- **Vitamin B12**: Supplement 2,000 mcg/day (metformin depletes B12, worsens neuropathy)

✓ **Nutrition (Critical for Sarcopenia Reversal):**
- **Protein**: 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day (essential for muscle synthesis in elderly)
  - Example: 70 kg × 1.2 = 84 g protein/day
  - Distribute across 3 meals (30 g per meal more effective than skewing to dinner)
  - Sources: Lean meats, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, protein shakes if appetite poor
- **Leucine-rich foods**: Whey protein (highest leucine content, triggers muscle protein synthesis)
- **Vitamin D**: Continue repletion (target >30 ng/mL)

✓ **Exercise (Physical Therapy Referral):**
- **Supervised PT**: 2-3 sessions/week for 12 weeks
  - Focus: Resistance training (light weights, resistance bands), balance training (Tai Chi, Otago exercise program)
  - Goal: Improve strength, balance, prevent falls
- **Home program**: Daily exercises (sit-to-stand, heel raises, marching in place)

---

**Month 3: Reassess and Intensify**

**Assessment:**
- Gait speed: 0.85 m/s (improved from 0.7, no longer frail)
- SPPB: 9/12 (improved from 7)
- Grip strength: 26 kg (improved from 22)
- No falls since Month 1
- HbA1c: 7.0% (improved)
- hsCRP: 2.8 mg/L (improved but still elevated)
- Vitamin D: 38 ng/mL (replete)

**Adjustments:**

✓ **Continue PT** (transition to maintenance phase, 1x/week)

✓ **Add Senolytic Consideration:**
- **Rationale**: Age 70 + frailty = likely high senescent cell burden
- **Testing**: Order p16 T-cell mRNA (if available) or proceed based on clinical phenotype (frailty = surrogate for high senescence)
- **Intervention**: Dasatinib 100 mg + Quercetin 1,250 mg, 2 consecutive days every 2 weeks × 6 cycles (12 weeks)
- **Monitoring**: CBC every 2 weeks (thrombocytopenia risk), repeat SPPB and gait speed at 12 weeks
- **Evidence**: Preclinical data shows senolytics improve physical function in aged mice; human IPF trial showed functional improvement

✓ **Add NAD+ Booster:**
- NMN 500 mg/day OR NR 1,000 mg/day
- Rationale: NAD+ depleted in elderly, mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to frailty
- Evidence: Small trials show possible energy/endurance improvement

---

**Month 6: Functional Improvement**

**Outcome:**
- Gait speed: 0.95 m/s (robust, no longer frail)
- SPPB: 10/12 (not frail)
- Grip strength: 29 kg (normal for age)
- No falls in 6 months
- Patient report: "I can walk around the block now. I have more energy."

**Long-Term Plan:**
- **Maintain** exercise (home program + group classes for social engagement)
- **Maintain** nutrition (high protein, vitamin D/B12)
- **Continue** NAD+ booster if patient attributes benefit
- **Repeat senolytics** every 6-12 months (if initial trial successful)
- **Monitor** quarterly (SPPB, labs)

**Outcome:** Reversed frailty → maintained independence, reduced fall risk, improved quality of life

---

### 7.3 Documentation Requirements for Reimbursement

**Time-Based Coding (99205, 99215 with prolonged services):**

Must document:
- Total face-to-face time with patient: "Total visit time: 75 minutes"
- Breakdown: "45 minutes spent counseling patient on longevity interventions, dietary modifications, and metformin risks/benefits. Remainder on examination and review of labs."

**Shared Decision-Making (Required for High-Level Codes):**

Document discussion:
- Options presented (lifestyle alone, metformin, NAD+ boosters, senolytics)
- Patient preferences elicited
- Risks/benefits explained
- Patient's choice documented

Example:
```
"Discussed three approaches to reduce patient's cardiovascular risk: (1) intensive lifestyle modification alone, (2) lifestyle + metformin for prediabetes prevention, (3) lifestyle + metformin + statin for lipid management. Reviewed evidence for each option. Patient expressed preference for option 2 (lifestyle + metformin) due to family history of diabetes and desire to avoid statin side effects. Informed consent obtained for off-label metformin use for longevity/prevention. Patient verbalized understanding of risks (GI side effects, lactic acidosis, B12 deficiency) and benefits (diabetes prevention, possible cardiovascular protection). Prescription provided."
```

**Medical Necessity Justification:**

For off-label medications (metformin for non-diabetics), document:
- Why standard care insufficient
- Evidence base supporting intervention
- Patient's informed consent

Example:
```
"Patient with prediabetes (HbA1c 6.0%) and strong family history of T2DM. Per ADA guidelines, metformin is recommended for diabetes prevention in high-risk individuals. Discussed evidence from Diabetes Prevention Program trial (31% risk reduction with metformin). Patient provided informed consent acknowledging off-label use for prevention rather than treatment of established diabetes. Will monitor HbA1c, CMP, and B12 every 3-6 months."
```

## 8. Patient Education Resources

### 8.1 Handouts to Create/Provide

**"Understanding Biological Age vs. Chronological Age"**
- Explain epigenetic clocks (DNA methylation patterns predict health outcomes better than calendar age)
- Include example: "You're 50 years old chronologically, but your GrimAge is 47 → you're aging slower than average"
- Visual: Graph showing biological age trajectories (accelerated aging vs. healthy aging)

**"Interpreting Your Epigenetic Clock Results"**
- GrimAge: Predicts lifespan, all-cause mortality
- PhenoAge: Predicts healthspan, age-related disease risk
- What affects epigenetic age: Smoking (accelerates +5 years), exercise (decelerates -2 years), diet, stress
- Goal: Keep biological age ≤ chronological age

**"Exercise for Longevity: Your Prescription"**
- Aerobic exercise: 150 min/week moderate OR 75 min/week vigorous
  - Examples: Brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming
  - Target heart rate: 50-85% max (220 - age)
- Resistance training: 2+ days/week, all major muscle groups
  - Examples: Weightlifting, resistance bands, bodyweight (push-ups, squats)
- Balance/flexibility: Yoga, Tai Chi (fall prevention)
- **Evidence**: Exercise is the single most potent longevity intervention (JAMA 2018: 7-8 year healthspan extension)

**"Mediterranean Diet Quick Start Guide"**
- What to eat:
  - Vegetables: 7-9 servings/day (variety of colors)
  - Fruits: 2-3 servings/day (especially berries)

**"NAD+ Boosters: What You Need to Know"**
- What is NAD+? Essential molecule for energy production, DNA repair, activating anti-aging enzymes (sirtuins)
- Why does it decline? NAD+ levels drop 50% by age 50 (due to decreased synthesis, increased consumption)
- How to boost it:
  - Supplements: NMN (250-500 mg/day), NR (1,000 mg/day)
  - Lifestyle: Exercise, caloric restriction, avoid chronic inflammation
- What to expect: Possible increased energy, exercise capacity (variable, not everyone responds)
- Safety: Very well-tolerated, minimal side effects

## 10. Safety & Ethics

### 10.1 Informed Consent Elements for Off-Label/Investigational Use

**Required Disclosures (Document in Chart):**

✓ **FDA Approval Status:**
- "Metformin is FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes but NOT for aging or longevity. We are using it 'off-label' based on strong evidence it may prevent diabetes and reduce age-related disease risk."

✓ **Evidence Base:**
- "The evidence comes from the Diabetes Prevention Program trial (prediabetes prevention), observational studies (cancer and cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetics), and the ongoing TAME trial (testing aging directly). Human lifespan data does NOT yet exist."

✓ **Alternative Options:**
- "Alternatives include: (1) intensive lifestyle modification alone (diet, exercise, sleep), (2) waiting for more definitive evidence from the TAME trial, (3) focusing only on established therapies for your risk factors (e.g., statins for high cholesterol)."

✓ **Risks:**
- Common: "GI side effects (diarrhea, nausea) occur in 20-30%, usually improve after 2-4 weeks. Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs long-term; you must supplement B12 daily."
- Rare but serious: "Lactic acidosis is very rare (<0.01%) but can be fatal; risk is higher if kidney function declines or if you become very ill (vomiting, dehydration). We will monitor your kidney function regularly."

✓ **Benefits:**
- "Potential benefits based on current evidence: reduced risk of diabetes (31% in DPP trial), possible reduced risk of cancer (31% in meta-analysis of diabetics) and cardiovascular disease (30-40% in diabetics). Whether these benefits apply to healthy individuals is uncertain."

✓ **Monitoring Plan:**
- "We will check your blood work every 3-6 months: kidney function, HbA1c, B12. You must inform me immediately if you develop severe illness, vomiting, or dehydration (hold metformin in these situations)."

✓ **Cost:**
- "Metformin is generic and inexpensive (~$10-20/month). Labs are covered by most insurance. Supplements (B12) are out-of-pocket (~$10/month)."

✓ **Patient Decision:**
- "Do you understand the risks and benefits? Do you have questions? Are you choosing to proceed voluntarily?"
- Document: "Patient verbalized understanding of off-label use, risks, benefits, alternatives. Provided written information sheet. Patient chose to proceed with metformin therapy. Informed consent obtained."

---

### 10.2 Red Flags: When NOT to Pursue Aggressive Interventions

**Absolute Contraindications:**

❌ **Active malignancy**
- Rationale: NAD+ boosters, mTOR inhibitors, senolytics may affect tumor biology (unknown direction)
- Recommendation: Defer longevity interventions until cancer in remission; oncologist clearance required

❌ **Severe organ dysfunction**
- Renal: eGFR <30 (metformin contraindicated, senolytic clearance impaired)
- Hepatic: Child-Pugh C cirrhosis (metformin contraindicated, drug metabolism impaired)
- Cardiac: Decompensated heart failure (hold metformin during acute illness)

❌ **Pregnancy or planning pregnancy**
- Rationale: No safety data for longevity interventions in pregnancy
- Recommendation: Discontinue metformin (unless for gestational diabetes), NAD+ boosters, senolytics; resume postpartum

❌ **Age <18 years**
- Rationale: Interventions target aging processes; not applicable to children/adolescents
- Exception: Metformin for prediabetes/PCOS in adolescents (standard pediatric indication)

---

**Relative Contraindications (Caution, Assess Risk-Benefit):**

⚠ **Age >80 with limited life expectancy**
- Rationale: Interventions take years to show benefit; if life expectancy <5 years, focus on quality of life
- Recommendation: Emphasize symptom management, functional optimization, deprescribing

⚠ **Poor adherence to basics (diet, exercise, medications)**
- Rationale: Adding more interventions when not following simpler ones is futile
- Recommendation: Simplify protocol, address adherence barriers, consider health coach support

⚠ **Unrealistic expectations ("I want to live to 150")**
- Rationale: Current interventions MAY add 5-10 healthy years; not 50 years
- Recommendation: Educate on realistic goals, manage expectations, focus on healthspan not lifespan

⚠ **Financial hardship**
- Rationale: Longevity interventions (advanced testing, supplements, cash-pay visits) can cost $5,000-20,000/year
- Recommendation: Prioritize low-cost high-impact interventions (lifestyle, generic metformin), skip expensive optional testing
- **Equity consideration**: Longevity medicine risks becoming accessible only to wealthy; advocate for insurance coverage and lower-cost options

---

### 10.3 Ethical Considerations

**1. Equity and Access:**
- **Problem**: Longevity medicine predominantly cash-pay → accessible only to affluent
- **Impact**: Exacerbates health disparities (wealthy live longer, healthier)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Offer sliding scale fees or charity care
  - Advocate for insurance coverage of preventive interventions (metformin for prediabetes IS covered by many plans)
  - Partner with community health centers to provide longevity education/lifestyle programs

**2. Overmedicalization of Aging:**
- **Problem**: Framing aging as "disease" may promote excessive pharmaceutical interventions
- **Balance**: Emphasize lifestyle as foundation; pharmaceuticals are adjuncts, not replacements
- **Avoid**: Prescribing metformin/senolytics to perfectly healthy young adults (low benefit, medicalization of normal aging)

**3. Informed Consent Rigor:**
- **Problem**: Patients may overestimate benefits of investigational interventions (senolytics, NAD+ boosters)
- **Solution**: Explicit disclosure of evidence gaps, uncertainty, investigational nature
- **Standard**: "I understand the evidence is preliminary; I may not benefit personally; I accept the risk"

**4. Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere):**
- **Risk of aggressive interventions**: Senolytics (thrombocytopenia), rapamycin (immunosuppression)
- **Threshold**: Only pursue if potential benefit substantially outweighs risk
- **Example**: 70-year-old with frailty (high senescent burden) → senolytics reasonable; 40-year-old healthy → senolytics NOT appropriate

**5. Respect for Autonomy:**
- **Patient choice**: Some patients prefer aggressive interventions despite uncertainty ("I'd rather try than regret not trying")
- **Physician role**: Provide evidence-based guidance, but respect informed patient decisions
- **Boundary**: Decline to prescribe if intervention clearly harmful or futile (e.g., rapamycin in 30-year-old)

---

### 10.4 Liability Considerations

**Off-Label Prescribing:**
- **Legal status**: Off-label prescribing is legal and common (40% of prescriptions in US are off-label)
- **Standard of care**: Must have reasonable medical justification, informed consent, monitoring
- **Documentation**: Extensively document rationale, consent, shared decision-making

**Investigational Interventions (Senolytics):**
- **Risk**: If adverse event occurs (e.g., senolytic-induced thrombocytopenia → bleeding), plaintiff may argue "experimental treatment without IRB oversight"
- **Mitigation**:
  - Informed consent emphasizing investigational nature
  - Close monitoring (CBC every 2 weeks initially)
  - Conservative patient selection (high senescent burden, age 60+, other options exhausted)
  - Consider IRB exemption if conducting systematic data collection (consult institution)

**Malpractice Insurance:**
- Inform malpractice carrier if offering longevity medicine (may affect coverage or premiums)
- Some carriers exclude "experimental" or "anti-aging" therapies → clarify coverage

**Professional Society Guidance:**
- No major medical societies (AMA, ACP) have specific guidelines on longevity medicine
- TAME trial results (2027-2028) may prompt guidelines on metformin for aging
- Until then, rely on evidence-based decision-making, informed consent, peer consultation

---

## Conclusion

Longevity medicine is transitioning from fringe biohacking to evidence-based clinical practice. The TAME trial, ongoing senolytic trials, and accumulating data on NAD+ boosters will define the next 5-10 years of the field. Physicians, nurse practitioners, and health coaches can NOW implement protocols grounded in Level 1a evidence (lifestyle, metformin for prediabetes) while judiciously offering investigational interventions (senolytics, NAD+ boosters) to carefully selected patients with extensive informed consent.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Lifestyle is the foundation** (Mediterranean diet, 150+ min/week exercise, 7-9 hours sleep, stress management)
2. **Metformin for prediabetes/metabolic syndrome** has strongest evidence (ADA-recommended, DPP trial)
3. **NAD+ boosters** restore biomarkers but functional outcomes mixed (offer to age 50+ with fatigue/mitochondrial dysfunction)
4. **Senolytics** show promise but remain investigational (require p16 testing, extensive consent, close monitoring)
5. **Biomarker-guided personalization** is critical (epigenetic age, senescent cell burden, NAD+ levels)
6. **Safety and ethics** paramount (informed consent, realistic expectations, avoid overmedicalization)

**The future is here—but unevenly distributed.** Providers who master this guide can offer patients evidence-based pathways to extend healthspan, reduce disease burden, and optimize the aging process. The goal is not immortality but maximizing healthy, functional years—**adding life to years, not just years to life.**
