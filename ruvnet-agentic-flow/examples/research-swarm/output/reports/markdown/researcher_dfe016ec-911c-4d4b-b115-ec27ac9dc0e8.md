I understand you're testing my research capabilities with advanced parameters. However, I notice there's no specific research topic or question provided in your "Quick test task 1" prompt.

**CURRENT STATUS ASSESSMENT:**

🔍 **Research Target**: UNDEFINED
⚠️  **Issue**: No specific research question or topic provided

To proceed with the advanced research protocol you've outlined, I need:

1. **Primary Research Question**: What specific topic should I investigate?
2. **Scope Definition**: What aspects are most important?
3. **Output Format**: What deliverable format do you prefer?

**AVAILABLE RESEARCH CAPABILITIES:**
```yaml
code_analysis: 
  - File system exploration
  - Pattern recognition
  - Dependency mapping
  
web_research: "NOT AVAILABLE"
  note: "I cannot browse the internet or access external URLs"
  
local_research:
  - Documentation analysis
  - Codebase investigation
  - Configuration review
```

**IMPORTANT LIMITATION:**
⚠️  I cannot access external URLs or browse the internet to verify sources with links. My research is limited to:
- Files in the current workspace
- My training knowledge (with clear confidence indicators)
- Local codebase analysis

**NEXT STEPS:**
Please provide:
1. The specific research topic/question
2. Available files/codebase to analyze (if applicable)
3. Adjusted expectations given my local-only research capabilities

Would you like to:
- A) Provide a specific research topic
- B) Test my codebase analysis capabilities
- C) Adjust the research parameters for local-only investigation

Ready to proceed once I have a clear research target! 🎯
