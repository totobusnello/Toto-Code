## Serverless Computing Context Analysis

### Lambda as Pure Serverless

According to the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/02/14/whats-serverless-computing-exploring-faas-serverless-and-more/) (2018), serverless computing exhibits these characteristics, all of which Lambda fully satisfies:

1. ✅ **No server management**
2. ✅ **Automatic scaling**
3. ✅ **Pay-per-execution billing**
4. ✅ **Built-in availability and fault tolerance**
5. ✅ **Event-driven architecture**

### EC2 in Serverless Patterns

EC2 can be configured for serverless-like patterns but requires additional services and management:

**Serverless-Adjacent EC2 Patterns:**
- **Auto Scaling Groups** with scale-to-zero capabilities (requires external triggers)
- **Spot Instances** for cost-optimized, ephemeral workloads
- **Container orchestration** (ECS/EKS) with Fargate for serverless containers

[CONFIDENCE: 88% - Based on architectural patterns documented in AWS Well-Architected Framework]
