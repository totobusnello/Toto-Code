## Core Research Findings: 3 Key Differences

### 1. **Architectural Complexity and Feature Engineering**

**Machine Learning:**
- Requires manual feature engineering and selection
- Uses shallow algorithms (1-3 layers typically)
- Human expertise needed to identify relevant data patterns

**Deep Learning:**
- Automatic feature extraction through multiple hidden layers
- Deep neural networks (3+ hidden layers, often 100s)
- Learns hierarchical representations automatically

### 2. **Data Requirements and Computational Resources**

**Machine Learning:**
- Effective with smaller datasets (hundreds to thousands of samples)
- Lower computational requirements
- Can run efficiently on standard CPUs

**Deep Learning:**
- Requires large datasets (thousands to millions of samples)
- High computational demands (GPUs/TPUs typically needed)
- Data-hungry approach for optimal performance
