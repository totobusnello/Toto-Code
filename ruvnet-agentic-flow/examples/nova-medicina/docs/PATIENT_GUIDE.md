## Common Questions

### Can this diagnose me?

**No.** Nova Medicina cannot diagnose you. Only licensed healthcare professionals can provide diagnoses.

Think of it like a GPS for directions:
- GPS suggests routes, but you still drive
- Nova Medicina suggests possibilities, but doctors diagnose
- GPS can be wrong, and so can Nova Medicina
- You need both the tool AND your own judgment

### Can I trust the results?

**Use them as helpful information, not absolute truth.**

Nova Medicina is built on medical knowledge and AI technology, but:
- It doesn't know your complete medical history
- It can't perform physical examinations
- It can't run diagnostic tests
- It might miss rare or unusual conditions

**Always verify important information with a real healthcare provider.**

### How accurate is it?

**Accuracy varies by situation.**

- **High accuracy** for common symptoms and conditions
- **Lower accuracy** for rare or complex situations
- **Confidence scores** help you understand uncertainty
- **Always improving** as it learns from medical research

**Real-world comparison:**
- Similar to asking a knowledgeable friend who reads medical information
- More informed than random internet searches
- Less accurate than a trained doctor with years of experience
- Useful as a starting point, not an ending point

### Will it share my data?

**No, your data is private by default.**

- Your health information stays confidential
- No selling of data to advertisers
- No sharing without your explicit permission
- You can delete your data anytime

**Exception:** If you choose to export and share information with your doctor, that's under your control.

### Does my doctor need to approve?

**No approval needed, but collaboration is encouraged.**

- You can use Nova Medicina independently
- Many doctors appreciate informed patients
- Share results with your doctor to get their professional opinion
- Your doctor can provide context Nova Medicina cannot

**Good approach:** Tell your doctor you're using health information tools and ask if they'd like to see the results during your appointments.

## Examples & Walkthroughs

### Example 1: "I have a headache"

**Your Input:**
> "I've had a headache for 3 hours. It's throbbing on both sides of my head. I'm also sensitive to light and feel a bit nauseous. I was stressed at work today and skipped lunch."

**Nova Medicina Analysis:**

```
Confidence Score: 82% (High)
Urgency: Low to Moderate
```

**Interpretation:**
- **High confidence** means the pattern matches well-known conditions
- **Low to Moderate urgency** means not emergency, but don't ignore

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Tension headache** (most likely given stress)
2. **Migraine** (light sensitivity and nausea suggest this)
3. **Hunger/dehydration** (you skipped lunch)

**What to Do:**
1. **Immediate Self-Care:**
   - Drink a glass of water
   - Eat a light snack
   - Rest in a dark, quiet room
   - Take appropriate pain reliever (like acetaminophen or ibuprofen)

2. **Monitor:**
   - If it improves in 1-2 hours: probably tension/hunger headache
   - If it continues or worsens: might be migraine

3. **Seek Care If:**
   - Pain becomes severe (8-10 out of 10)
   - You develop fever or stiff neck
   - You have vision changes or confusion
   - It lasts more than 24 hours

4. **Follow-Up:**
   - If you get frequent headaches, schedule appointment with doctor
   - Keep a headache diary to identify triggers

---

### Example 2: "My blood pressure is high"

**Your Input:**
> "I measured my blood pressure and it's 150/95. I usually run around 120/80. I feel fine, no symptoms. I'm 45 years old and don't take any medications."

**Nova Medicina Analysis:**

```
Confidence Score: 85% (High)
Urgency: Moderate - Schedule doctor visit within days
```

**Interpretation:**
- **High confidence** because blood pressure readings are objective
- **Moderate urgency** because it's elevated but not crisis level

**Understanding the Numbers:**
- **Normal:** Less than 120/80
- **Elevated:** 120-129/less than 80
- **High (Stage 1):** 130-139/80-89
- **Your reading (150/95):** Stage 2 hypertension

**What to Do:**

1. **Don't Panic:**
   - One high reading doesn't mean you have chronic hypertension
   - Stress, recent activity, or caffeine can raise blood pressure temporarily

2. **Re-Check:**
   - Wait 30 minutes in a calm state
   - Take another reading
   - If still high, that's important information

3. **Call Your Doctor:**
   - Schedule an appointment within the next few days
   - Bring your blood pressure readings
   - Discuss your overall cardiovascular health

4. **Lifestyle Review:**
   - Reduce salt intake
   - Exercise regularly (if doctor approves)
   - Manage stress
   - Limit alcohol and caffeine

**When It's an Emergency:**
- Blood pressure above 180/120 with symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache) = Call 911
- Your reading of 150/95 without symptoms = Schedule doctor visit, but not emergency

---

### Example 3: Understanding Confidence Scores

**Scenario A - High Confidence (92%):**
```
Symptoms: Runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes, no fever
Season: Spring
Duration: 3 days

Analysis: Seasonal allergies (allergic rhinitis)
Why high confidence: Classic allergy symptoms during allergy season
```

**What this means:**
- Pattern is very clear
- Well-documented in medical literature
- Still worth confirming with doctor if persistent
- Self-care often effective (antihistamines, avoid triggers)

---

**Scenario B - Medium Confidence (65%):**
```
Symptoms: Fatigue, occasional dizziness, mild headaches
Duration: 2 weeks
Context: No clear pattern or trigger

Analysis: Multiple possibilities including anemia, thyroid issues, stress, sleep problems
Why medium confidence: Symptoms are non-specific and could indicate several conditions
```

**What this means:**
- Not enough information for certainty
- Physical exam and tests needed
- See your doctor for proper evaluation
- Blood work might be necessary

---

**Scenario C - Low Confidence (45%):**
```
Symptoms: Unusual combination of symptoms that don't fit typical patterns
Duration: Variable
Context: Complex medical history

Analysis: Uncertain - requires professional evaluation
Why low confidence: Pattern doesn't match common conditions well
```

**What this means:**
- This is beyond Nova Medicina's ability to assess accurately
- Definitely see a healthcare provider
- Don't rely on self-care alone
- Might need specialist evaluation
