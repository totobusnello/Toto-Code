# Claude Setup Optimizer

Automatically analyzes the Claude Code changelog and recommends improvements to your agents, skills, and configuration based on new features.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Fetches Latest Changelog** - Gets the most recent Claude Code changelog from official sources
2. **Analyzes Your Setup** - Reviews all your agents, skills, commands, and configuration
3. **Identifies Opportunities** - Finds ways your setup could benefit from new Claude features
4. **Recommends Improvements** - Provides specific, actionable recommendations
5. **Implements Changes** - Optionally applies improvements automatically

## Paths

Claude Code searches for skills/agents in multiple locations with this precedence:

1. **Managed** (enterprise) - Organization-wide
2. **Personal** - `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/agents/`, `~/.claude/commands/`
3. **Project** - `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/` in current project

### User's Setup

All personal skills, agents, and commands are stored in a single iCloud location. The `~/.claude/` directory has symlinks pointing directly to iCloud:

**Source of Truth (iCloud):**

```
/Users/ps/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup/
├── skills/       ← All skills
├── agents/       ← All agents
├── commands/     ← All commands
└── settings.json ← Settings
```

**Symlinks (how Claude finds them):**

```
~/.claude/skills   → iCloud/claude-setup/skills
~/.claude/agents   → iCloud/claude-setup/agents
~/.claude/commands → iCloud/claude-setup/commands
```

**Convenience symlinks (for editing via code/claude path):**

```
/Users/ps/code/claude/skills   → iCloud/claude-setup/skills
/Users/ps/code/claude/agents   → iCloud/claude-setup/agents
/Users/ps/code/claude/commands → iCloud/claude-setup/commands
```

**All paths resolve to the same iCloud location.** Edit via any path - changes sync everywhere.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Claude Code Changelog

Fetch the latest Claude Code changelog from multiple sources:

**Primary Source - GitHub Releases:**

```
https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases
```

**Secondary Source - Changelog File:**

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/main/CHANGELOG.md
```

**Tertiary Source - Web Search:**
Search for "Claude Code changelog 2025" or "Claude Code new features" for recent announcements.

Extract key information:

- New features and capabilities
- New tools or MCP changes
- Skill/agent system updates
- Configuration options
- Breaking changes
- Best practice updates

### Step 2: Analyze Current Setup

**Inventory all skills:**

```bash
# All skills are in one place (via ~/.claude/skills symlink to iCloud)
find ~/.claude/skills -maxdepth 2 \( -name "SKILL.md" -o -name "skill.md" \) 2>/dev/null
```

For each skill, read and extract:

- Name and description
- Allowed tools
- Triggers/activation patterns
- Dependencies

**Inventory all agents:**

```bash
# All agents are in one place (via ~/.claude/agents symlink to iCloud)
find ~/.claude/agents -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null
```

For each agent, read and extract:

- Name and purpose
- Tools it uses
- Subagent relationships

**Inventory all commands:**

```bash
# All commands are in one place (via ~/.claude/commands symlink to iCloud)
ls ~/.claude/commands/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Read configuration files:**

```bash
# Settings in iCloud
cat "/Users/ps/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup/settings.json"

# Global Claude config
cat ~/.claude.json
```

### Step 3: Compare and Identify Opportunities

Cross-reference changelog features against your current setup:

**Feature Categories to Check:**

1. **New Tools**: Are there new tools you're not using that could benefit your workflows?
2. **Skill System Updates**: Has the skill format changed? Are there new frontmatter options?
3. **Agent Improvements**: New agent capabilities or patterns?
4. **MCP Updates**: New MCP servers or protocol changes?
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Parallelization, caching, or efficiency improvements?
6. **Security Features**: New permission patterns or security best practices?
7. **Configuration Options**: New settings that could improve your experience?

**Analysis Checklist:**

For each skill/agent, check:

- [ ] Uses latest skill format (SKILL.md with frontmatter)
- [ ] Takes advantage of parallel tool calls where applicable
- [ ] Uses appropriate model selection (haiku for fast tasks, etc.)
- [ ] Has proper error handling patterns
- [ ] Follows current best practices for triggers/descriptions
- [ ] Uses new tools/features that weren't available before

### Step 4: Generate Recommendations

Create a structured report with:

**Priority Levels:**

- **HIGH**: Security improvements, breaking change migrations, significant efficiency gains
- **MEDIUM**: New feature adoption, best practice updates
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements, style updates

**Recommendation Format:**

```markdown
## [Priority] Recommendation Title

**Affected Items:** skill-name, agent-name, etc.

**Current State:**
Description of how it works now

**Recommended Change:**
What should be changed and why

**New Feature Reference:**
Link to changelog or documentation

**Implementation:**
Specific steps or code changes needed

**Effort:** Low/Medium/High
```

### Step 5: Present and Confirm

Present findings to the user:

```
# Claude Setup Optimization Report

## Changelog Summary
- Version X.Y.Z released on DATE
- Key new features: [list]

## Your Setup Analysis
- X skills analyzed
- Y agents analyzed
- Z commands analyzed

## Recommendations Found: N

### High Priority (M items)
1. [Brief description]
2. ...

### Medium Priority (N items)
1. ...

### Low Priority (P items)
1. ...

Would you like me to:
1. Show detailed recommendations for all items
2. Show only HIGH priority recommendations
3. Auto-implement all HIGH priority changes
4. Auto-implement specific recommendations
5. Skip implementation (just review)
```

### Step 6: Implement Improvements

**IMPORTANT: iCloud is the source of truth.** All changes MUST be made directly in the iCloud path to ensure they sync across devices:

```
/Users/ps/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup/
```

For approved changes:

1. **Back up affected files first (in iCloud):**

```bash
ICLOUD_PATH="/Users/ps/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup"
mkdir -p "$ICLOUD_PATH/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
cp <file> "$ICLOUD_PATH/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/"
```

2. **Apply changes using Edit or Write tools to the iCloud path directly**
   - Always use the full iCloud path: `/Users/ps/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup/...`
   - Do NOT edit via symlinks (`~/.claude/` or `/Users/ps/code/claude/`) to ensure changes are persisted to iCloud

3. **Validate changes:**

- Check syntax/format is valid
- Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality

4. **Verify files exist in iCloud:**

```bash
ls -la "/Users/ps/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup/skills/<skill-name>/"
```

5. **Sync to GitHub skills repo (escotilha/skills):**

After making changes to iCloud, update the public GitHub repo:

```bash
# Copy updated files to the skills repo
SKILLS_REPO="/tmp/skills-repo"
git clone https://github.com/escotilha/skills.git "$SKILLS_REPO" 2>/dev/null || (cd "$SKILLS_REPO" && git pull)

# Copy the updated skill/agent
cp -r "/Users/ps/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/claude-setup/skills/<skill-name>" "$SKILLS_REPO/skills/"

# Commit and push
cd "$SKILLS_REPO"
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: update <skill-name> with latest changes"
git push
```
