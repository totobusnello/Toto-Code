# charting-vega-lite

Create interactive data visualizations using Vega-Lite declarative JSON grammar. Supports 20+ chart types (bar, line, scatter, histogram, boxplot, grouped/stacked variations, etc.) via templates and programmatic builders. Use when users upload data for charting, request specific chart types, or mention visualizations. Produces portable JSON specs with inline data islands that work in Claude artifacts and can be adapted for production.
