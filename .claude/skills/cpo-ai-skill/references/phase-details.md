"/>
```

**Output Files Generated:**
- `tech-stack-recommendation.md`
- `architecture-overview.md`
- `deployment-guide.md`
- `adr/` (Architecture Decision Records)

### Step 2.1: Epic Decomposition

Break the product into high-level epics (major feature areas):

```markdown
## Epic Structure

| Epic | Description | Priority | Dependencies |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| E1: Foundation | Project setup, auth, database | P0 | None |
| E2: Core Features | [Main functionality] | P0 | E1 |
| E3: User Experience | [UI/UX polish] | P1 | E2 |
| E4: Integration | [External services] | P1 | E2 |
| E5: Production | Testing, docs, deployment | P0 | E3, E4 |
```

### Step 2.2: Stage Definition

Each epic breaks into implementable stages:

**Stage Sizing Rules:**
| Right-sized Stage | Too Big (Split) |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| 3-7 user stories | More than 10 stories |
| 1-3 hours work | Full day or more |
| Single feature area | Multiple unrelated features |
| Clear completion criteria | Vague "make it work" |

### Step 2.3: Story Breakdown

For each stage, define user stories following autonomous-dev format:

```json
{
  "id": "S1-US-001",
  "title": "Story title",
  "description": "As a [user], I want [capability] so that [benefit]",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Specific criterion 1",
    "Typecheck passes",
    "Tests pass"
  ],
  "priority": 1,
  "dependsOn": []
}
```

### Step 2.4: Generate Master Project File

Create complete `master-project.json` (see templates.md for full structure).

### Step 2.5: Initialize Progress Tracking

Create `cpo-progress.md` (see templates.md for structure).

### Step 2.6: Generate Cost Estimate

Before presenting the plan, calculate and display infrastructure costs:

```markdown
## Resource & Cost Estimate

### Development Scope
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Epics | [N] |
| Stages | [M] |
| User Stories | [X] |
| Complexity | [Low/Medium/High] |

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)
| Service | Tier | Cost |
|---------|------|------|
| [Hosting] | [Tier] | $[X] |
| [Database] | [Tier] | $[X] |
| [Auth] | [Tier] | $[X] |
| **Total** | | **$[X]/month** |

### At Scale (10K users)
| Service | Tier | Cost |
|---------|------|------|
| [Hosting] | [Pro] | $[X] |
| [Database] | [Pro] | $[X] |
| **Total** | | **$[X]/month** |

*Estimates based on typical usage. See [cost-estimation.md](cost-estimation.md) for details.*
```

### Step 2.7: Present Plan for Approval

```markdown
## Strategic Plan Summary

**Product:** [Name]
**Epics:** [N] major feature areas
**Stages:** [M] implementation stages
**Stories:** [X] total user stories
**Estimated Complexity:** [Low/Medium/High]
**Estimated Cost:** ~$[X]/month (MVP) → ~$[Y]/month (at scale)

### Execution Order

1. **Stage 1: [Name]** ([N] stories)
   - [Story 1]
   - [Story 2]

2. **Stage 2: [Name]** ([N] stories)
   ...

### Quality Gates

Each stage will be:
1. Implemented via autonomous-dev (with backend-api-agent/frontend-design-agent delegation)
2. Tested via fulltest-skill
3. Committed only when tests pass
4. Pushed to repository

Ready to begin implementation?

Reply with:
- "start" - Begin Stage 1
- "adjust [stage]" - Modify stage plan
- "reorder [stages]" - Change execution order
- "costs" - Show detailed cost breakdown
- "questions" - Discuss the approach
```

---

## Phase 3: Stage-by-Stage Implementation

**Goal:** Implement each stage sequentially with quality gates.

### Step 3.0: Load Project State

At the start of EVERY stage:

```bash
cat master-project.json
cat cpo-progress.md
```

Find the next stage: first with `status: "pending"` ordered by dependencies.

### Step 3.1: Initialize Stage

```markdown
## Starting Stage [N]: [Name]

**Epic:** [Parent Epic]
**Dependencies:** [Completed stages this depends on]
**Stories:** [N] user stories

**Objectives:**
- [Objective 1]
- [Objective 2]

Delegating to specialized agents for implementation...
```

### Step 3.2: Delegate to Specialized Agents

**Stage Type Detection → Agent Selection:**

| Stage Type | Primary Agent | Secondary |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Foundation (Stage 1) | database-setup-agent | autonomous-dev |
| UI/Frontend | frontend-design-agent | autonomous-dev |
| API/Backend | backend-api-agent | autonomous-dev |
| Full-Stack | frontend + backend agents | autonomous-dev |
| Testing/Validation | fulltest-skill | - |
| Deployment | deployment-agent | - |

---

#### For Foundation Stage (Stage 1) - Database + Environment Setup

```xml
<Task subagent_type="database-setup-agent" prompt="
## Database Setup: [Product Name]

**Provider:** [Supabase/Neon/PostgreSQL from CTO recommendation]
**ORM:** [Prisma/Drizzle]

### Schema Requirements (from Product Definition)
- Users with authentication
- [Core entities from product definition]
- [Relationships]

### Deliverables
1. Database provisioning (if Supabase/Neon)
2. Schema file (Prisma or Drizzle)
3. Initial migration
4. Seed data for development
5. RLS policies (if Supabase)

See: subagents/database-setup-agent.md
"/>
```

**Then generate environment configuration:**

```bash
# Generate .env.example based on stack
cat > .env.example << 'EOF'
# Application
NODE_ENV=development
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database (from CTO recommendation)
DATABASE_URL=

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Add stack-specific variables...
EOF
```

---

#### For UI/Frontend Stages - Use Frontend Design Agent

**CRITICAL:** Always pass research findings to the frontend agent. Read research files first:

```bash
# Load research from Phase 1
cat design-references.md
cat competitor-analysis.md
cat market-insights.md
```

Then invoke with research context:

```xml
<Task subagent_type="frontend-design-agent" prompt="
## Frontend Design: Stage [N] - [Name]

**Product:** [Product name]
**Stage Objective:** [What this stage delivers]

### Research Input (from Product Research Agent)
[Paste key findings from competitor-analysis.md, design-references.md, market-insights.md]

### Design Direction (derived from research)
- **Aesthetic:** [Direction based on references]
- **Differentiator:** [What makes us unique vs competitors]

### Tech Stack
[Frontend framework, styling approach from CTO agent]

### Components/Pages to Build
1. [Component/Page 1] - [Purpose]
2. [Component/Page 2] - [Purpose]

See: subagents/frontend-design-agent.md
"/>
```

---

#### For API/Backend Stages - Use Backend API Agent

```xml
<Task subagent_type="backend-api-agent" prompt="
## API Implementation: Stage [N] - [Name]

**Product:** [Product name]
**Stage Objective:** [What this stage delivers]

### Endpoints to Implement
- [METHOD] /api/[path] - [Purpose]
- [METHOD] /api/[path] - [Purpose]

### Authentication
[JWT/Session/API Key from CTO recommendation]

### Tech Stack
[Framework from CTO agent - Next.js API Routes, Express, tRPC]

### Database
[ORM and schema from database-setup-agent]

### Requirements
- Error handling following API conventions
- Input validation with Zod
- Proper HTTP status codes

See: subagents/backend-api-agent.md
"/>
```

---

#### For Full-Stack Stages

Run both frontend and backend agents, then autonomous-dev for integration.

### Step 3.3: Delegate to Autonomous Dev

Create stage-specific `prd.json` and invoke autonomous-dev:

```javascript
// Generate prd.json for this stage
const stagePrd = {
  project: masterProject.project.name,
  branchName: `feature/stage-${stage.id}`,
  description: stage.description,
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  verification: masterProject.verification,
  userStories: stage.stories.map(story => ({
    ...story,
    passes: false,
    attempts: 0,
    notes: ""
  }))
};
```

Launch autonomous-dev:

```xml
<Task subagent_type="general-purpose" prompt="
## Autonomous Development: Stage [N] - [Name]

You are implementing Stage [N] of the [Product Name] project.

### Context
[Include relevant context from master-project.json]

### Stage Objectives
[Stage description and goals]

### User Stories to Implement

[Paste stage.stories as formatted list]

### Existing Codebase Patterns
[Include patterns from AGENTS.md if exists]

### Implementation Instructions

1. Create feature branch: `feature/stage-[N]-[name]`
2. Implement each story following the prd.json format
3. Run verification after each story
4. Commit passing stories immediately
5. Report completion with summary

### Verification Commands
- Typecheck: [command]
- Test: [command]
- Lint: [command]

Begin implementation. Report progress and any blockers.
"/>
```

### Step 3.4: Monitor Stage Progress

Track autonomous-dev progress:
- Stories completed
- Issues encountered
- Learnings captured

Update `master-project.json`:
```json
{
  "stages": [{
    "status": "in_progress",
    "startedAt": "[timestamp]"
  }]
}
```

### Step 3.5: Stage Completion

When autonomous-dev completes the stage:

1. **Verify all stories pass:**
   ```bash
   cat prd.json | jq '.userStories | map(select(.passes == true)) | length'
   ```

2. **Update master project:**
   ```json
   {
     "stages": [{
       "status": "implemented",
       "completedAt": "[timestamp]"
     }]
   }
   ```

3. **Run stage testing:**

### Step 3.6: Stage Testing

Invoke fulltest-skill for the stage:

```xml
<Task subagent_type="general-purpose" prompt="
## Stage Testing: Stage [N] - [Name]

Test all functionality implemented in this stage.

### What Was Built
[Summary from autonomous-dev output]

### Test Scope
- New endpoints: [list]
- New UI components: [list]
- New database operations: [list]

### Test Commands
[Include verification commands]

### Test Scenarios
[Generate test scenarios based on user stories]

Run comprehensive tests and report:
1. What passed
2. What failed (with details)
3. Recommended fixes

If using fulltest-skill with a web UI, test at the configured URL.
"/>
```

### Step 3.7: Handle Test Results

#### If all tests pass:

1. Update master project:
   ```json
   {
     "stages": [{
       "status": "tested",
       "testedAt": "[timestamp]"
     }]
   }
   ```

2. Commit the stage:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat(stage-[N]): [Stage Name]

   Implemented:
   - [Story 1]
   - [Story 2]

   Tested: All stories pass"
   ```

3. Push to repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/stage-[N]-[name]
   ```

4. Update progress log:
   ```markdown
   ## [Timestamp] - Stage [N]: [Name] COMPLETE

   **Stories Completed:** [N]
   **Tests Passed:** All
   **Commit:** [hash]

   **Key Implementations:**
   - [What was built]

   **Learnings:**
   - [Patterns discovered]
   ```

5. Continue to next stage (Step 3.0)

#### If tests fail:

1. Analyze failures:
   ```markdown
   ### Test Failures for Stage [N]

   | Test | Error | Root Cause | Fix Required |
   |------|-------|------------|--------------|
   | [test] | [error] | [cause] | [fix] |
   ```

2. Re-invoke autonomous-dev with fixes:
   ```xml
   <Task subagent_type="general-purpose" prompt="
   ## Fix Stage [N] Test Failures

   The following tests failed:
   [Failure details]

   Root cause analysis:
   [Analysis]

   Required fixes:
   [List of fixes]

   Implement fixes and verify tests pass.
   "/>
   ```

3. Re-test (max 3 iterations)

4. If still failing after 3 iterations:
   ```markdown
   Stage [N] has persistent test failures.

   Options:
   1. Review failures manually
   2. Simplify stage scope
   3. Get user input on blockers
   4. Skip non-critical tests and continue

   What would you like to do?
   ```

### Step 3.8: Stage Completion Check

After each stage:

```javascript
const remainingStages = stages.filter(s => s.status !== 'tested');
if (remainingStages.length === 0) {
  // All stages complete - proceed to Phase 4
  output("ALL STAGES COMPLETE - Beginning full project validation");
} else {
  // Continue to next stage
  continueToNextStage();
}
```

---

## Phase 4: Full Project Validation

**Goal:** Comprehensive testing of the complete integrated product.

### Step 4.1: Merge All Stage Branches

```bash
# Ensure we're on main branch
git checkout main

# Merge each stage branch
for stage in S1 S2 S3...; do
  git merge --no-ff feature/stage-${stage}-[name] -m "merge: Stage ${stage}"
done
```

### Step 4.2: Full Integration Testing

```xml
<Task subagent_type="general-purpose" prompt="
## Full Project Validation: [Product Name]

All stages have been implemented. Run comprehensive integration testing.

### Project Summary
- Epics: [N]
- Stages: [M] (all implemented and individually tested)

1. [Journey 1: e.g., User registration to first action]
2. [Journey 2: e.g., Core workflow completion]
3. [Journey 3: e.g., Error handling scenarios]

Report comprehensive results including:
- Overall test pass rate
- Any failures with root causes
- Performance observations
- Security considerations
"/>
```

### Step 4.3: Fix Any Integration Issues

If integration issues found:

1. Categorize by severity:
   - **Critical**: Blocks core functionality
   - **High**: Significant impact on UX
   - **Medium**: Edge cases or minor issues
   - **Low**: Polish or optimization

2. Fix critical/high issues before proceeding

3. Log medium/low as known issues for future iteration

### Step 4.4: Quality Gate

Only proceed to Phase 5 when:
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Critical user journeys work
