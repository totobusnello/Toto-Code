# FACT System - Project Overview

## Introduction

The FACT (Fast-Access Cached Tools) system is a production-ready financial data analysis platform that combines intelligent caching, secure tool execution, and natural language processing to deliver fast, accurate responses to financial queries.

## Purpose and Vision

FACT transforms how users interact with financial data by:
- **Eliminating Query Complexity**: Natural language interface removes the need for SQL knowledge
- **Maximizing Performance**: Intelligent caching reduces response times from seconds to milliseconds
- **Ensuring Security**: Read-only database access with validated query execution
- **Providing Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

## Key Features

### 🚀 Core Capabilities

- **Natural Language Processing**: Powered by Claude Sonnet-4 for understanding complex financial queries
- **Intelligent Caching**: Cache-first architecture with 85%+ hit rates reducing costs by 90%
- **Secure Tool Execution**: Sandboxed SQL execution with injection protection
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance metrics, usage tracking, and health monitoring
- **Interactive CLI**: Command-line interface for seamless user interaction

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Three-Tier Architecture**: User → FACT Driver → Claude Sonnet-4 → Arcade Gateway → Data Sources
- **Cache-First Design**: Leverages Claude's native caching for static content optimization
- **Tool-Based Retrieval**: Authenticated tools for secure dynamic data access
- **Minimal Infrastructure**: No vector databases or complex indexing required

### 🛡️ Security Features

- **SQL Injection Protection**: Comprehensive query validation and sanitization
- **Read-Only Access**: Database permissions limited to SELECT operations only
- **Input Validation**: Syntax checking and complexity limits on all queries
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all queries and tool executions
